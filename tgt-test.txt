And so on 15 June , while still at Kalimpong , he sent a letter to President Roosevelt of the U . S . A . bemoaning India ' s helpless predicament as a British colony at a time when the free world elsewhere was faced with a life - and - death struggle .
A free India would be an asset to the free world , an enslaved India merely a burden and a liability .
On 7 August 1940 the University of Oxford held a special Convocation at Santiniketan for the purpose of conferring on Tagore its Doctorate ( honoris causa ) .
Pending the arrival of Indian doctors from Calcutta , the British Civil Surgeon from Darjeeling was frantically begged to come .
He came reluctantly and having examined the patient , gruffly inquired if he understood English .
No sadder instance can be cited of the rapidly increasing alienation of the British ruling class from the people of the land .
He diagnosed kidney infection and insisted on performing then and there a drastic surgical operation , if the unconscious patient ' s life was to be saved .
He looked helplessly at Mahadev Desai and the tears streamed down his cheeks .
He was always so self - controlled that even in the hardest bereavement and sorrow I had never seen him break down .
Now He was never to recover the full use of his faculties , but was soon able to sit up in bed and to talk .
His hand was not steady enough to hold the pen , but since words and rhymes kept on buzzing in his head , he had to dictate his poems .
Strangely enough , during this period when his interest in the life of the common people of his country was most vivid and realistic , his poetry shows the sprouting of a mystic sensibility which was later to grow and suffuse much of his writing .
He was not a philosopher , he found no bondage more irksome than that of a closed and formulated . system of thought which has an explanation for everything .
" How artificial and unreal are our notions of sin and virtue ! " he wrote in 1894 .
" There is no higher religion than that of sympathy for all that lives .
Its " sprouting " at this period of his life simply means that this vague awareness became more conscious and explicit and became a quest for the guiding Muse of his genius and destiny , the Personality within and above his personality .
In a letter of March 1894 he wrote : " I am overwhelmed by this awareness of the baffling mystery within which I can neither understand nor control . . .
Too weak to deliver it himself , it was read for him in his presence .
Both his own people in India and the peoples in Europe and the Far East were passing through a period of great travail , in different ways and for different reasons .
He wen ton to analyse how this " graceless disillusionment " was the result of the cynical disregard by the British rulers of the very values which were the pride of western civilisation .
" The wheels of Fate will one day compel the British to give up their Indian empire .
But what kind of India will they leave behind , what stark misery ?
When the stream of their two centuries ' administration runs dry at last , what a waste of mud and filth they will leave behind them ! "
But even in the darkest gloom Tagore ' s testament could not end in a note of despair .
Though his own sympathies were with the Chinese , Russians and the Allies , he did not think of the Germans and the Japanese as the sole and unmitigated villains in the drama .
The world he had not tired of repeating was caught in a vicious trap of its own making , whereisms of diverse kinds merely helped to make its strangle hold more vicious , and where the greedy merchant , the crafty priest and the power - hungry politician exploited the passions of the common people , their capacity for hatred and heroism , to serve their own ends .
In the midst of this suffering , physical and mental , and his literary preoccupations , his thoughts would now and again wander to his beloved Santiniketan and the little children in the school .
The school was his first love which he had . somewhat ignored when the glamorous Visva - Bharati came on the scene .
Now the old solicitude returned .
Hewenton to recall how he used to lose himself in joy when teaching children .
His voice was thick as he added , " But I can no longer teach them myself , nor supervise . "
He saw to it that jars of lozenges and boxes of chocolates were always kept at hand for the little ones who never went in to his room without coming out with something in their hand or mouth .
A pariah dog , not to be left out , managed to make itself an honoured inmate of the house by the simple process of seeking shelter under his reclinirlg chair .
One of the poems of Arogya is on this nameless dog whose sad and mute devotion must have touched the heart of the convalescing poet .
Filling its heart words of despair seem to rise in lament , the voice of emptiness laden with compassion whose inmost meaning cannot be grasped . His fortitude and his kindly sense of humour remained with him till the end .
Those who attended on his sick - bed treasured as their greatest reward the pleasantries and witticisms he constantly exchanged with them .
He could not get over his amusement at being fed on Glaxo and would refer to himself as " Glaxo baby . "
Since then each time Glaxo was brought , he would inquire , " How many months old am I today ? "
The trees were perhaps his oldest love .
As a little boy he had been fascinated by the ancient banyan at which he gazed from a window of his ancestral home where he was kept confined within a chalk circle by the servant who kept guard on him .
Immobilised again in his last months , he would watch with wistful tenderness the graceful shimool outside his cottage in Santiniketan .
During the summer drought he was distressed at the fate of the trees in the asrama .
The trees must be saved at all cost .
When it grows , you will see how Santal women will gather under it to pick the flowers from which they make their wine . "
Reluctant to taste the most carefully prepared delicacies made to tempt his palate , he would nibble , eagerly and excitedly like a child , at a wild jambu berry when a bunch of them was brought to him .
He kept the bunch near his bed and would tempt the visitor , ' Just try one and see how sweet my jambus taste .
Three days before his birthday which by Bengali calender was due to be observed on 8 May , he dictated the last song ( words and music ) he was to compose .
He never had recourse to notations but would sing the song as the tune came to him , and some one else had to catch the tune from him and give the notation .
In this last song of his , which was first sung on his last birthday and is still sung on each anniversary of his birthday , he invoked the Ever New to reveal itself afresh .
May you be revealed as the Sun is revealed dispersing the veil of mist ,
may the unending wonder of the Endless be made manifest , proclaiming Life ' s victory !
When faith asserts its robustness : Death , like Rahu ,
It was not a blind for self - deception .
He will not shut his eyes to the hard reality of suffering on this earth , to the seeming indifference of Providence and Nature to what happens to individual life .
Nor will he , in the bitterness of frustrated arrogance or self - pity , deny or repudiate the terrible beauty of truth .
A week after his birthday he muses again on . the mystery of creation , looks steadily , without blinking .
But there are many Bengali critics , discerning , mature and sophisticated , who believe that in these last poems , brief , tense and compact , was born " a terrible beauty " such as is not to be found in his earlier poems , superb and almost perfect as some of them are .
These poems dictated before his death were published posthumously as Sesh Lekha ( Last Writing ) .
As a religious institution and place of worship , the temple in India has had a hoary past .
As a structure that enshrines a god or some other object of veneration , circumambulation ( pradakshina ) , adoration and worship ( puja ) , it has had a varied growth in different parts of the subcontinent .
This was according to the local needs and credal requirements and subject , of course , to the interplay or exchange of thoughts and ideas .
The builders or the craftsmen sthapatis and the silpins who belonged to the same guilds of artisans , had common principles and set methods of design and construction and they worked in collaboration with the priesthood which knew the rituals , the nature of the object of veneration , and the modes of their worship .
Besides the relief sculpture they carry inscriptions of the seventh - eighth centuries and later .
Temples as places of worship the podiyil or manram , or murramhad objects of worship that were very often mere mounds or platforms medaiunder a particular tree in the village .
Sometimes they were trilithons of a stone slab placed over two uprightsthe terri which survive even today in some remote parts .
Some of the platforms had a post , or kandu , representing the deity planted over them .
From some of the brief descriptions in the earliest Tamil works , we learn that the kandu , as the abode of a deity , stood in a pillared hall , or podiyil , on a platform that was cleansed and smeared with water and cowdung by young women who , after a dip in the bathing ghat , lighted an ever - burning lamp near the kandu .
We are also told that many came here to worship with offerings or bali .
The Buddha - pitikai or Dharma - pitikai as the object of worship by the Buddhists is referred to in the Tamil epic , Manimekalai .
From its brief description it would appear to have been a circular padma - pitha , or seat of expanding lotus petals , mounted over a square plinth , also with a lotus petal base , the whole evidently of brickwork .
The entrance has brickwork jambs into which a wooden door - frame was fitted .
The roof was evidently a vault made up of corbelled brickwork that was plastered and perhaps also cribbed inside with wooden ribs and crosspieceson the analogy of an earlier rock - cut chaitya of the same plan .
The remains of another chaitya noticed near Vidyadharapuram , near Vijayawada , are of like nature .
A somewhat better preserved stupa - shrine or stupa - chaitya , where the central object of worship was the representation of a stupa , has come up from the excavations at Salihundam ( Srikakulam district , Andhra Pradesh ) .
The circular chaitya is brick - built .
The massive wall has a stepped up base provided with a narrow vestibule for approach in front , resembling the antarala of later temples .
Several subsidiary shrines of identical shape also exist there .
In Nagarjunakonda and other Andhra Buddhist sites , the brick - built chaitya temples are associated with viharas or monasteries , where they are often found as apsidal structures on either side of the passage behind the main vihara entrance , or are found in pairs in front of the major stupas or maha - chaityas , which were themselves open or hypaethral temples , facing each other .
The excavations in Nagarjunakonda have also revealed large non - Buddhist temple complexes of the Ikshvaku kings ( third and fourth centuries AD ) dedicated to Siva , Vishnu , Kartikeya and Devasena .
The structures after which such excavations were made were , therefore , essentially apsidal temples .
These belong to the period between the second century BC and the second century AD .
The rest belong to the period after the fourth century AD .
They were excavated in the time of the Vakatakas , mostly between AD 450 and 600 .
The last ones were excavated around AD 650 .
The activity in general , and particularly the embellishments , however , continued till the times of the Rashtrakutas in the eighth - ninth centuries AD .
The early chaityas are large , apsidal , with an elaborate facade , having horseshoe - shaped windows on the top of the entrance ,
A rock - cut stupa , in the apse portion , formed the object of worship .
The viharas were astylar halls , with a number of monks ' cells excavated into their three side walls , the hall having one or more main entrances in front .
The rock architecture of the second phase consists of two apsidal chaityas ( 19 and 26 ) .
It is similar to the earlier type but has a Buddha figure prominently standing out in front of the stupa in the apse , under a nasika or arch projected from the drum of the stupa .
The viharas , except those unfinished or destroyed ( 3 , 5 , 14 , 23 , 24 , 28 , and 29 ) , combine the characteristics of monasteries and shrines in them , the latter aspect becoming more prominent .
These viharas generally consist of an outer verandah or porch , corresponding to the mukha - mandapa or agra - mandapa of the temple complexes , a pillared hall ( sometimes astylar ) , corresponding to the maha - mandapa with a shrine or garbha - griha at its rear , often with an ardha - mandapa , or transversely rectangular ante - chamber intervening between the shrine and the main hall .
When the hall has pillars instead of a central nave and lateral aisles pattern , the arrangement of a central square enclosed by four or more pillars the others forming a peripheral series would suggest a ranga - mandapa on the model of or anticipating the Chalukyan navamngas .
Often there are additional chaityas or cells on either side of the principal one on the rear wall of the hall , and also in the lateral walls of the front porch , or agra - mandapa . Even the two - storeyed excavation ( Cave 6 ) has essentially the same plan .
The sanctum contains a large figure of the Buddha , often with other sculptures in the ardha - mandapa .
In the case of Cave 27 , the ardha - mandapa is advanced into the maha - mandapa .
The arrangement of a succession of mandapas , one behind the other , with one or more shrine cells at the rear , is on the pattern found in the brick - temple complexes of the Ikshvaku period in Nagarjunakonda that preceded these later excavations in Ajanta .
In few cases , as in the Ajanta examples , the cave - temple has a large and almost square mandapa , corresponding to the hall with the sanctum behind , the transverse rectangular ardha - mandapa being eliminated .
In a temple complex with such an axial arrangement , the sanctum does not appear to have had a superstructure of the pyramidal type .
These cave - temples , including the chattya - mandiras , may as well be called mandapa - temples as they are designated in later inscriptions .
The key to the title of the volume which also indicates the general spirit and tenor of the poems may be sough tin the very first poem where the poet addresses the Universal Spirit or Nature as the Wondrous Lady whose beauty is manifest in a million forms .
But though in the outside world her beauty overflows in many different sights , colours and sounds , within the mind she sits alone , unique immanent and pervading .
He was , above everything else , a lover who saw beauty in the commonest things , who felt its touch in the outside world and felt it in his inmost being and knew that at some level of the subconscious or superconscious the two were intimately linked .
The same spirit that suffused and ruled this vast universe dwelt within him and guided his life and genius .
He felt its immediacy and its intimacy and addressed it as the Lord of his life , his Jivan - devata .
In his famous poem of that name he says , " O my Inmost Being , is your thirst quenched by coming into my heart ?
I have crushed my heart , like grapes in the press , and filled your cup with a thousand pourings of joy and sorrow .
The intervening minor and subordinate dynasties , wedged among the three imperial powers as buffer states , also took part in the activity and contributed to this movement in their respective regions .
There had been a lingering tradition of a taboo on stone for sacred and secular structures , because of its long local association with funerary erections , as has been noted before .
Mahendra I , perhaps taking the cue , excavated his first cave - temple at Mandagappattu ( South Arcot district ) for the Hindu trinity Siva , Vishnu and Brahma .
Thus , his craftsmen had the advantage of the long acquired know - how of such cutting into sandstone and carving them , which had been developing for nearly a millennium .
The first cave - temple was , as a result , bold and ambitious in design and of larger dimensions .
Close on Mangalesa ' s first cave - temple followed other similar cave - temples of the Chalukyas in Badami , Aihole , and other places , all excavated into the same soft rocks .
The shrine fronts , one , three or five , are at the rear of the inner mandapa , project more into the mandapa , and have all the angas of a vimana front , namely , moulded adhishthana , pilasters , or kudya - stambhas , with capital components as detailed above and prastara with well - formed kapota and kudu decorations .
The further superstructure of the vimana is not shown , as in a depiction of the interior aspect of a mandapa with the shrine behind , the upper parts of the vimana would not be visible .
The prastara of the shrine front abuts on the mandapa ceiling . There are eight such cave - temples in various stages of completion : the Koneri mandapam , the Varaha mandapam , the Mahishamardini mandapam ( locally called Yamapuri mandapam ) , an unfinished cave - temple next to the Koneri mandapam , the Pancha - Pandava mandapam , the Adivaraha cave - temple called Paramesvara Mahavaraha Vishnu - griha in its inscriptions and the Ramanuja mandapam . Of these the Varaha and Ramanuja mandapams have undivided mandapas while the Koneri mandapam and the Adivaraha cave - temple have their mandapas divided into ardha - and mukha - mandapas by an inner line of pillars .
The Pancha Pandava mandapam records an attempt to cut a square central shrine with a surrounding cloister in the form of a mandapa having two rows of pillars running all round .
The Varaha mandapam and the Adivaraha cave - temples have each a single shrine - cell while the Mahishamardini and the Ramanuja mandapams have three shrine - cells in them ; the Koneri mandapam has five in a row behind the mandapam .
Rock architecture was also sustained longer as a mode in the northern zone .
It developed more vigorously particularly under the Rashtrakutas as could be seen from their enormous output and such large - scale compositions as the caves at Elephanta , Dhumarlena and Jogeshvari , not to speak of the monolithic carvings of the Kailasa temple , and the Jain Chota Kailasa and the Jain chaumukh in the Indra Sabha complex .
But rock architecture soon became a mere second to structural stone constructions in the southern zone of the Chalukyas as would be seen in the sequel .
This was due to the fact that with the facility of quarrying the soft sandstone blocks , dressing and carving them more easily with the help of the skills acquired , coupled with the urge to construct stone temples on the models of brick - and - wood originals , the stone workers of the Badami - Aihole - Pattadkal area soon trained themselves into guilds of sthapatis that could build temples better instead of carving them out of rocks .
The structural creations of the Rashtrakuta period are , however , less pretentious , of medium or small dimensions , and less well - finished as compared with their rock - cut monuments .
The lay - out plan of the cave - temples varied from the structural temples in the successive rise in floor levels of the axial mandapas and shrines , in the much raised level of the sanctum floor , though the ceiling level throughout remained the same .
In the first group would be those that follow the scheme generalized by the later Buddhists in that area , namely , the vihara - chaitya type , with a cella and a frontal - pillared hall .
Thirdly , there would be those which show or tend to show the side shrines in the form of chambers containing panel sculptures and Saptamatrika shrines with a regular or principal sanctum at the rear , which is sandhara or one provided with a circumambulatory passage round it , with ardha - and maha - mandapas often having vedi parapets .
This , among other things , would indicate the early enunciation of the Agami , or ritual principles , which were elaborated and re - codified in later times .
The mandapa in front of the early cave - temples has more bays laterally on the transverse axis and only one bay at either end of the long axis .
In the Ajanta viharas on the other hand , the mandapa is a concentric scheme with one bay all round the central bay , which is often larger than the rest .
While this navaranga , or concentric nine - bay pattern , is repeated in the main scheme in the structural temples of the Chalukyan series , later , the Badami cave , mandapa - type also finds its structural analogues particularly in temples of the south - west Deccan , west Mysore and the Konkan and Malabar coasts down to the times of the Ikkeri Nayaks of the seventeenth century .
The provision of more aisles or bays parallel to the central nave with only one extreme bay at either end of the longitudinal axis finds its application in structural temples where the lateral bays , with pillars or walls of diminishing height from the centre , carry successively stepped down , slopy or flat roofs .
Such early structural temples are the Ladkhan in Aihole and the Kallamatha in Badami .
It would be evident that this feature in rock architecture is after the contemporary and earlier brick - and - timber structural models .
As a result the intercolumniation of the facade is not generally equal , the central pillars having a wider interspace than the lateral ones .
In Badami there are four cave - temples excavated at various heights on the vertical scarp of the sandstone rock .
The sanctum entrance is guarded by huge dvarapalas .
The exhibition of the bhuta gana friezes in the facade dwarf wall and the bracket figures , on the other hand , would take this excavation closer to the Badami group , thereby indicating the first quarter of the seventh century as its date .
Caves 20 , 22 , 23 and 24 , adjacent to this , would also belong to about the same period .
The Ravana - ki - kai ( Cave 14 ) is of a simpler plan , with a large pillared mandapa and a sandhara shrine at its rear .
The pillars are of the kumbha - valli type .
On either side of the shrine entrance , there are a number of carved images , including the two dvarapalas .
On the mandapa walls , and carved in the recesses between the pilasters , are sculptural compositions , Saivite and Vaishnavite .
The cella is rectangular and has provision for a platform on its rear with a socket in it for Vishnu or Durga , but not for Siva or a linga .
This excavation in the pre - Rashtrakuta series can be dated near AD 700 .
Cave 25 , or the Kumbharvada , has multiple shrine - cells as in Bhokardan and has lateral galleries attached to the antechamber .
While Cave 27 may be of the transitional period between the Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas , Cave 25 should be earlier , datable to the second half of the seventh century .
The Dasavatara , or Cave 15 , is an odd example in as much as it is the only two - storeyed cave - temple or cave - complex of a very large size .
It is apparently a case of reconditioning of what all was prepared and cut out for Buddhistic requirements .
It would mark the earliest example of Rashtrakuta work at Ellora .
Its front pavilion carries the inscription of Dantidurga ( c . 752 - 756 ) and is an accomplished piece of contemporary rock architecture .
The detached Nandi - mandapa is four - pillared with flights of steps at the front and the rear .
The facade of the temple that rises beyond has its two storeys with two rows of pillars , one above the other , the pillars being square and reminiscent of the arrangement in the Tin - tal cave of Ajanta .
The groundfloor is a compartment with fourteen square pillars and the upper floor has the plan of a large pillared mandapa with central nave and lateral aisles and a shrine with a linga at the rear .
The linga - pitha is circular .
The Jain excavations ( Caves 30 to 34 ) mark the last phase of activity in Ellora commencing from about AD 800 and continuing into the next century .
They follow mostly the earlier Hindu examples in plan and design , differing only in their sculpture and iconography .
The Indra Sabha ( Cave 32 ) and the Jagannath Sabha ( Cave 33 ) standing close together , are both two - storeyed excavations .
The Indra Sabha has in its open forecourt the chaumukh Jain monolithic temple .
The lower storey of the cave is an unfinished hall , mostly with simple pillars , some of them moulded .
The hall has a pillared portico , and there are two side shrines projecting on either side of the front .
The Jagannath Sabha , though of the same type , lacks the regularity of the plan .
The only exception is the aberrant Undavalli cave - temple which is dedicated to Vishnu .
The Nandi in Saiva cave - temples is rock - cut as in the Pandyan examples farther south .
In point of time the Akkanna - Madanna cave at Vijayawada in its present form comes first .
The last , if not of direct Eastern Chalukyan vintage , can at best be of Telugu - Chola authorship .
These cave - temples essentially consist of a rock - cut hall , or mandapa , with one or more , often three , shrine - cells behind .
The mandapa is in some cases astylar and in others multi - pillared , or demarcated into front and rear sections by two rows of pillars and pilastersthe usual facade row and the parallel inner row .
The pillars are usually simple , thick - set , short and square in section throughout , or have their middle height bevelled at the corners .
This results in the middle section being octagonal , while the basal and apical sections are square in plan .
The entrance , another characteristic storeyed structure of the south , was called the dvarasobha , mahadvara , or gopura , according to its stature and magnitude .
Often the additional mandapa was an unattached auxiliary structure standing separately in the forecourt inside the prakara .
The stature of the main vimana , with its adjunct , the ardha - or mukha - mandapa , was increased by the addition of a platform , the upa - pitha , below the adhishthana .
The rest of the figure sculpture was accommodated even on the pillars of the mandapa .
With the increasing importance and elaboration of rituals and multiplication of festivals , additions , both axial and peripheral , were made to this nuclear structure .
These took the form of auxiliary mandapas on the axial line and subsidiary shrines or vimanas , mandapas ( halls ) , and malikas or cloisters , surrounding the central unit .
The whole was enclosed by one or more prakaras , with one or more gopura entrances , resulting in the familiar temple complex of south India .
In cases , like the Brihadisvara at Thanjavur , the entire temple complex was planned and designed at the same time and executed almost simultaneously .
All this was actuated by the desire to construct vimanas of impressive loftiness on comparatively smaller base areas The quadrature or the sides of the aditala in the case of four - sided , polygonal , circular or apsidal structures , could be broken by offset projections or bays at intervals , starting from the lowermost part of the adhishthana This scheme could be carried up to the talas above also , resulting in a scheme of bays at the corners and along the sides , with intervening recesses .
This part called malasthana and padma bandha marks the top end of the shaft and the beginning of the capital which consists of moulded parts , a pitcher , lasuna or kalasa , placed over the padma bandha , a saucer - shaped part called tadi , a flattened , bulbous or cushion - shaped member over it called the kumbha carrying an inverted platter - shaped part , and a doucine moulding , called the pali ( or padma when it is shaped to simulate an inverted lotus blossom with petals ) which really forms the underside of a plank - like abacusthe phalaka .
The phalaka , large , thick and square in earlier forms , became polygonal or circular and thinner and smaller in later temples .
It supports the corbel - bracket or block , potika , which carries the beam , or uttira .
Thus there are the squatting or rearing vyalas ( mythical lion - like forms with transformed faces ) , elephants , nagas , nagadevas , bhutas , etc .
The pillar shaft , as also the capital components , except the phalaka ( which remains always square in earlier forms ) , may , instead of being four - sided or square , have six , eight , sixteen or more sides , or be circular in section .
In the earlier series of temples mostly the alpa and jati vimanas prevailed .
These small and middle size gopuras were single - or two - or three - storeyed , called dvarasobha , dvarasala , dvaragopura , etc .
From the close of the tenth century onwards when larger vimanas came to be constructed , the gateway came to assume correspondingly larger proportions , becoming many - storeyed and called mahadvara , or gopura , or rajagopuram .
The gateways also tended to increase in height and size , ultimately to become the dominating structures of the temple complex .
This could be seen particularly in the case of those ancient temples where the main vimana nucleus that was ancient was kept intact and the prakara and gopura adjuncts came to be successively added round it in later times as in the Chidambaram , Tiruvannamalai , Madurai and Srirangam temple complexes .
There was thus a shift in emphasis from the main vimana in the gopura , with the result that while in the earlier temple complexes , as in the Brihadisvara temple at Thanjavur , the sky - line descends from the stupi of the main vimana to the outer of the two front gopuras built almost in the same period as the main vimana , it ascends from the centre to the outermost gopura in the four temple complexes mentioned above .
THE MONOLITHIC VIMANA FORMS While the Chalukyas of Badami started constructing structural temples of the very tractable sandstone closely following their earlier excavated rock - cut cave - temples in the same type of rock , the Pallavas were faced with a very hard and intractable materialthe granites and charnockites .
Besides carving out a few vimana forms as miniature reliefs or full - scale facades , they also started carving out three - dimensional monolithic vimanas of normal stature , and of diverse kinds .
This was a sequel to the experience they gained in the cutting in of cave - temples in hard stone .
It is both the vehicle of an idea and a study of conflicting loyaltiesin which respect it may be said to belong to the same class as his earlier play , Sacrifice .
Hero , too , the forces of Brahminism , of Hindu orthodoxy , are ranged against the challenge of compassion , of universal love in this case as specifically taught by the Buddha .
In the Buddha , according to him , the Hindu race and thought had achieved its finest flowering .
He was to write many poems and plays drawing on Buddhist legends and motifs .
Malini , the King ' s daughter in the play , is his first major Buddhist heroine .
But the most live and convincing character in the play is not this lovely and saintly but somewhat shadowy maiden , but her chief enemy , the leader of the Hindu orthodoxy , in whose proud personality is symbolised the strength and obstinacy of his religion .
The conflict is not only between obedience to " moth - eaten scriptures " and a religion of one ' s choice but between the poetry of pity " and the prose of social necessity .
" Pity is beautiful like the yonder moon that casts its spell in the sky , but is that the only enduring reality ?
The two smallest ones lack the prastara part .
Thus this ratha alone would illustrate the various forms of nasikas as described in the texts .
The two - storeyed Ganesa ratha is nirandhara , single - walled , and with a narrow mukha - ma ' uapa in front and of the same length as the aditala .
The mandapa is walled on its shorter sides and round the front corners leaving an open facade in front , with vyala - based pillars and pilasters .
The Pallava vogue of creating cut - out monolithic temple forms was soon caught up , as it were , not only by the neighbours of the Pallavas in south India , but also by others much beyond , and quite a few monolithic temples of the southern and northern types were created in various parts of India , from the Tirunelveli district at the far southern tip of the peninsula to the Kangra district in the foot - hills of the Himalayas in the north ; from Bihar in the east to Mandsaur in the west and Gwalior in central India all within the two succeeding centuries .
Following this pioneering work of the Pallavas , a few attempts at the cutting out of monolithic vimana forms in the same or succeeding centuries are noticeable in the Eastern Chalukyan region north of the Pallava territory of Tondaimandalam .
The smaller vimana is three - storeyed , all square on plan , but with octagonal griva and sikhara and stupi on top .
While the aditala is devoid of the hara elements on top , it has , like the top tola , four seated bhutas placed at the corners blowing conches .
The hara elements are found over the second tala on all the four sides , and again over the ardha - mandapa in front of the aditala .
The talas are proportionately tail , the top tala rising high and clear over the hara elements of the tala below , the stupi over the octagonal griva and sikhara being made of polished black basalt .
The pilasters on the walls have rearing lion bases , as is characteristic of the Rajasimha temples .
It is essentially square on its base and tolas , but its east - facing aditala has smaller oblong shrines with cells attached to the middle of its south , west and northern sides over corresponding offset extensions of the adhishthana .
The corresponding oblong attachment on the east with the passage through it , forms the antarala entrance to the main sanctum .
The two lateral shrines facing east as also the rear shrine facing west are like the main sanctum , dedicated to Siva .
The Virattanesvara temple at Tiruttani ( Chingleput district ) affords a very good example of a single - storeyed vimana square in its adhishthana and aditala that carries an apsidal griva sikhara superstructure .
' It was built of hard black stone in the ninth century in the time of Pallava Aparajitavarman , one of the last rulers of the dynasty .
It contains some good bas - reliefs in its wall niches which exemplify the definite polarisation of the deities in the vimana and ardha - mandapa devakoshthas , namely , Ganesa and Durga respectively , in the southern and northern outer wall niches of the ardha - mandapa and Dakshinamurti , Vishnu and Brahma respectively , in the south , west and north outer wall niches of the aditala wall .
The introduction of a projected gargoyle - like water - outlet , the pranala , from the northern side of ttiegarbha - griha floor to drain off the abhisheka water , till now not noticed in earlier temples , is another noteworthy feature .
The credit of constructing fine vimanas of hardstone , though small , and perfecting the same would , however , go to the contemporary Pandyas of the south who , following their rock - cut temples and the single carved - out monolithic vimanathe Vettuvankovil at Kalugumalai ( AD 800 ) , built a series of small karralis , or all - stone temples , in the southern districts .
The series of small and elegant all - stone temples at Kaliyapatti , Tiruppur , Visalur and Panangudi ( Pudukkottai district ) have square ekatala vimanas with simple moulded adhishthanas , less than 2 metre square at the base , carrying on top over the cella a square griva and sikhara .
In addition to the vimana koshtha devatas in the prescribed order as mentioned above , in the context of the Tiruttani Virattanesvara , they have eight smaller sub - shrines , the ashta parivara , dedicated to the ancillary deities located on the corners and sides and inside the prakara wall that surrounds the nuclear vimana and its axial adjuncts . While all the rest of the eight sub - shrines are square on plan like the main vimana , the one on the middle of the south side , dedicated to the Saptamatrikas , is rendered oblong with an appropriate sola sikhara as exemplified in the typical temple complex of the Sundaresvara at Tirukkattalai ( Pudukkottai district ) .
The oblong form with sala sikhara became the invariable rule , according to prescription and practice , for all the devi shrines .
His short stories created a new form in literature and set a standard which has not been surpassed in Indian literary achievement not even by his own later stories .
Apart from his creative prose , the range and quantity of his reflective prose of the period is astonishing .
There was hardly a subject which he did not tackle , including philology and science , and in almost everything he said he opened out new lines of thinking .
The elements are dramatically characterised ; fire and water are feminine inquisitive and emotional , the other three masculine , earth stolid and opportunist , air an idealist , and ether vague .
The author himself plays the part of a mediator , now provoking , now debunking and now clarifying the different points of view , an Indian Plato with a Shavian wink in his eye .
The square aditala outer wall carries on top over its prastara four karnakutas at the corners and four salas in between over the central bays of the wall The adhishthana below is extended forward and widened to form the base of the wider square mandapa in front .
The central bays of its walls have devakoshthas for sculptures of Siva , as on the vimana wall , and the recesses have perforated windows .
Both these temples show some advanced features such as the elaborately carved over - door of the shrine entrance in addition to the niche decoration already noticed , and in having a water - chute , or channel , on the floor of the shrine with an outlet opening on the northern side .
The Malegitti Sivalaya standing on an outer crag among the hills of Badami is the simplest structure consisting of a ponderously built single - walled nirandhara vimana composed of large blocks of sandstone , with a closed mandapa almost of the same width in front of it , preceded by an open four - pillared porch of a lesser width , all standing over a common moulded adhishthana .
The ham of four karnakutas and four salas of the aditala of the vimana is extended over the mandapa in front , the two front vimana karnakutas being also the rear karnakutas of the mandapa .
The second tola of the vimana has a similar hara of four kutas and four salas .
Four more large karnakutas closely adhere to the griva sikhara and conceal the corner faces of the octagonal griva , partially over - topping the squat dome of the octagonal sikhara and thereby lending a peculiar appearance to this vimana .
The cardinal faces of the griva have four nasikas of equal size .
The three bays on the vimana wall on each of its faces correspond , respectively , to the two extreme karnakutas and central sola , with plain rectangular niches for sculptures of deities .
His countrymen love these clever and wise sayings and love to quote them wisdom , like medicine , is more platable when dispensed in the form of tablets but that the author himself did not attach much value to them might be guessed from the title he gave to the volume Kaniha ( Trifles ) .
EVEN while Rabindranath was writing that he wanted nothing more in life than to be allowed to watch its lovely panorama from his boat on the river , he was getting restless for a more active and crowded existence .
The sleeping giant of nationalism was beginning to stir in his land and the British Government was getting nervous and apprehensive .
Beneath its cloak of benevolence the sword rattled .
In 1898 the Sedition Bill was passed to stifle nationalist agitation and the great scholar - patriot , Tilak , was arrested .
The poet jumped into the fray and one the day before the Bill became an Act read his famous paper on " Kantharodh " ( The Throttle ) at a public meeting in Calcutta .
He raised his powerful voice against the repressive policy of the Government and actively participated in raising funds for Tilak ' s defence .
When , soon after , the plague broke out in Calcutta he assisted Sister Nivedita in organising relief and medical aid for the victims of this dead epidemic .
The poet was turning into a healer of his people ' s wounds and a high priest of their national aspirations , not only raising his voice but leading an active hand in service at the front .
It has the loftiest known or achieved vimana , 66m high , standing over a basal square , one side of which is about 28m in length and which , in due proportion to the elevation , forms an appropriately broad , high and amply moulded upa - pitha platform , on which the boldly moulded adhishthana of the east - facing pyramidal vimana rests .
The same upa - pitha and adhishthana are extended forward as basal structures of the axially placed ardha - , maha - and mukha - mantfapas , connected to the main vimana by a north - south transept across the ardha - mandapa , reached from either side by flights of steps over the heights of the upa - pitha and adhishthana .
The pillard maha - and mukha - mandapas are closed on their sides , the rows of pillars inside forming a central nave and lateral aisles which , in the maha - mandapa part , are raised as a continuous platform on either side of the central passage formed by the nave .
The structure of pillars and roof over the frontal landing , constituting an open porch , or agra - mandapa , are later replacements over the original adhishthana and upa - pitha with a flight of steps added in front in addition to the two original ones on the sides .
While the transversely designed mukha - mandapa as also the connecting transept rise in four storeys , the maha - mandapa was originally three - storeyed .
The top storey was evidently an open terrace , with a row of Nandis placed on the coping of its walls .
The basal part of the vimana enclosing the garbha - griha is of two talas and is double - walled in the sandhara mode , each of the walls , outer and inner , of the same thickness and very massive .
These two walls enclose inner circumambulatories in two tiers , since the inner wall of the sanctum too rises vertically to the same height of two storeys , in order to accommodate the colossal linga , and its equally immense linga - pitha in the sanctum .
The outer wall , like the adhishthana below , is externally relieved into five bays on each face , the central ones on the south , west and north having the large door - openings in two tiers , one over the other , for both storeys of the inner circumambulatory .
Parallel in mood and temper to his political activities were his literary offerings of the period ballads , narrative poems , and dramatic episodes recreating his country ' s past .
" Hymns to the gods and the praises of worthy actions , " opined the Greek philosopher in his Republic , " are the only sort of poetry to be admitted to our state .
For if you were to admit the pleasurable muse also , in songs or verses , we should have pleasure and pain reigning in our state instead of law . "
Did the philosopher overlook that pleasure and pain are the very pulse of life and without them the reign of law could only ensure the uniformity of life lessness ?
Plato ' s approval of Rabindranath would have been short - lived in any case .
Two major volumes of this period , Katha ( Ballads ) and Kahini ( Tales ) , are masterpieces of narrative verse and dramatic dialogue .
The lyric poet , the dramatist and the story - teller have pooled their genius to make some of these pieces rank among Tagore ' s finest legacies to his people , cherished as much by the young as by the old .
An idea of his power of seizing on the dramatic possibilities of a situation which is only baldly referred to in the pages of the Mahabharata can be had if one compared such pieces as " Kama and Kunti " or " Gandhari ' s Prayer " with the original narrative in the Indian epic .
The poet ' s increasing concern with basic moral and spiritual values is the chief characteristic of these poems &gt; apart from their exquisite poetry , narrative skill and dramatic power .
The square vimana with a boldly moulded adhishthana over a high upa - pitha is likewise sandhara in its two vertical lower talas .
The Brihadisvara vimana of Gangaikonda - cholapuram differs from its predecessor and supposed model of the same name in Thanjavur in one important respect .
It has only a single entrance on the east on both the functional lower storeys and is not chaturmukha or sarvatobhadra as the Thanjavur temple is .
The tapering superstructure of further talas resting on the third tala , rendered in a similar kadalika karana mode , assumes an embowed outline at the corners in contrast to the severely straight corner lines of the Thanjavur vimana .
This is an aesthetic achievement , resulting from the clever interposition of octagonal kutas in the hara elements of the upper talas as karnakutas at the corners .
Externally this vimana may be said to excel its predecessor in the matter of quality , fineness and variety of bold sculpture , as also the more aesthetic design of its superstructure .
Internally , however , it lacks the other embellishments , namely , the paintings and depiction of dances .
The smaller temple units , called the Uttara Kailasa and Dakshina Kailasa on either side of the main vimana , also belong to about the same period .
The wholly apsidal and multi - storeyed main vimana , built of blackstone of the Tiruvorriyur temple near Madras , is another fine temple , though it is a smaller structure of Rajendra I Chola .
The foundation inscription is interesting in that it defines the type of stone used as krishna - sila - LCB - blackstone ) , gives an account of the angas or parts of the vimana by which it was embellished , and also the name of the architect - designer .
In front of the three external openings of the mandapas are two short flights of steps down the adhishthana and upa - pitha heights , respectively , with two miniature vimana models posed at either end on the ground level and on top of the flight of steps over the upa - pitha platform .
The bases of the peripheral pillars of the navaranga and its three porches were interconnected by kakshasana platforms over which a few generations later ( in the time of Ballala II who built the tank at the north - east corner and the prakara ) , perforated screen walls were fitted between the pillars , making the mandapa a closed one .
The adhishthana tiers of the vimana antamla and mandapa are profusely carved with long lines of friezes of animals , men and narrative scenes .
The overhanging kapota of the mandapa is supported by numerous finely - carved female figures in graceful poses called madanikas .
The superstructure of the main vimana is now lost .
The pillars inside the mandapa are exquisitely lathe - turned or intricately carved , and a few of them carry fine , bold , figure sculptures .
The raised coffer - like central ceiling of the mandapa , rising in eight tiers by stepped - up triangular slabs cutting the corners successively , forms a sort of octagonal hollow dome with all the tiers intricately carved .
The temple thus is a veritable museum of sculptures , large and small , and intricate vegetal , floral and animal carvings .
The sikhara on top also appears to have been square .
The mandapa with offset sides has four carved pillars at its centre round a raised floor with a ceiling , which is a grid of nine squares , each containing a lotus .
The Namesvara temple in another part of the village , consecrated in about 1202 by Nami Reddi , is a more elegant structure with carving and sculpture richer than in the larger Erakesvara .
It consists of the vimana facing east and open mukha - mandapa connected by an antarala .
The mandapa is of the navaranga pattern with four central pillars round the centre of the floor and twelve more pillars on the periphery .
Adjacent to the Namesvara is a triple - shrined unit with three shrines opening on the south , west and north of a common mukha - mandapa .
The three shrines , all alike , are comparatively plain structures built of large slabs of stone with no decorations on their exterior .
The shrines named Namesvara , Kamesvara and Kachesvara ( now called Mukkanti Siva temple ) were built by Nami Reddi at the beginning of the thirteenth century .
The ruined brickwork superstructure has lost many of its distinctive features .
The temple complex at Ghanapur ( Warangal district ) inside the mud - fort at the centre of the village is another example of a Kakatiya temple complex .
Axially there is a ruined mandapa in front of the eastern porch .
The surrounding parivara shrines are of varied character , with or without a front mandapa .
Some of them have tiered superstructures still extant with sukanasika projections , in some of which the kuta sola elements of the southern vimana are evident .
Many of them have square sikharas .
In one case at least the crowning part is of the amalaka type .
There are about a dozen temples , not very outstanding , inside the Warangal fort , many of them only , small structures like the Virabhadra , Mandalamma , Rama , Vishnu , Venkatesa , Svayambhu , Nelasambhu , Jangamesvara , and Devi temples .
The two small temples at Katachpur ( Kataksliapura ) in the same district are trikuta with their superstructures lost .
The superstructure over the stone - built body in many cases , especially the larger temples , is of brick and mortar .
These miniature shrine tops here and elsewhere are of the vimana type with a square or circular sikhara or of the prasada type with an amalaka on top .
Another characteristic decorative motif seen is a cruciform rosette , or a lotus with four petals spread crosswise , a pattern that one finds carried over to the Ikkeri area of the late Vijayanagar empire and the temples of the Keladi Nayakas there .
There are nearly fifty temples of the Kakatiyas known , but they are mostly in various stages of ruination .
A few of these temples , however , are of the Kadarnba - Chalukya vimana pattern which have been dealt with separately .
After the early Muslim inroads into the south which had abated the hitherto continuous temple - building activity , there was apparently a temporary lull for less than half a century .
The rise of the militant Vijayanagar empire to halt the Muslim conquest in the middle of the fourteenth century ( which , in the process , soon encompassed the whole of the peninsula ) almost gave a new and vigorous spurt to temple architecture by way of repairs or additions to existing structures , and erection of new ones .
In their northern domain , the imperial rulers , with their capital at Vijayanagar or Hampi , inherited the architectural traditions as carried down till their times by the later Chalukyas , Kakatiyas and Hoysalas , and in their southern provinces the tradition as developed up to the times of the later Pandyas .
Thus their temples in their northern domains in the Deccan , Andhra and Karnataka regions retain much that was of Chalukyan - Hoysala - Kakatiya inspiration , while their more southern constructions in Tamil Nadu and southern Kerala continued the traits of the Pallava - Chola - Pandya architecture .
But as already stated , they made one significant change in so far as the northern regions were concerned : in all the places throughout their vast empire they adopted and spread the hardstone tradition and technique and building to the exclusion of the hitherto prevalent softstone constructions .
In their vast capital of Hampi , now ruined , there are scores of temples , all of hard stone , exhibiting the traits from one of the two sources , the Chalukya - Rashtrakuta - Hoysala - Kakatiya series , and the Pallava - Chola - Pandya series .
Their subsequent capitals at Penukonda ( Anantapur district ) , Chandragiri ( Chittoor district ) , and Vellore ( North Arcot ) , and their environs , and their provincial capitals or seats of viceregal Nayakas as at Vellore ( North Arcot ) , Gingee ( South Arcot ) , Thanjavur , Madurai , and Ikkeri ( Shimoga district ) also have temples of their period .
Some of their temples are remarkable for the great size of their component structures , i . e . the mandapas and gapuras .
It marked a definite break and made the designers and the architect - sculptors think in terms of the new material and urged them to put forth their best , both in terms of number and quality that would reflect the aim and genius of the Vijayanagar epoch .
He was a sanyasin of the Sringeri Sankaracharya lineage ordained by the great pontiff Vidyasankara , also called Vidyatirtha and himself became the pontiff as second in succession to him .
Under the aegis of the saint , Virupaksha I celebrated his coronation in the new capital on 18 April 1336 in the presence of God Virupaksha , undertaking to rule the kingdom as the agent of the deity , in token of which he adopted the royal sign manual Sri Virupaksha that continued as such ever since .
The wind was chilly and after the bath the Queen who was in a gay mood felt it would be gratefun if she could warm herself near a fire .
Seeing an humble cottage nearby she ordered her companions to set fire to it .
As the flames fanned by the wind shot up high the Queen was delighted and returned to the palace , pleased with a morning well spent .
The King sent for the Queen and asked her how she could do a thing like that .
The Queen smiled and said , " The loss is negligible " .
The King replied , " You shall judge that for yourself , " and ordered that the Queen be divested of all her jewels and other valuables and asked to leave the palace .
" Go and earn or beg your livelihood , " he said to her .
" Only then you will understand how great was the loss of the poor man whose cottage was burnt down for your moment ' s pleasure .
After you have made enough to rebuild the cottage , I shall take you back as my Queen . "
But " hymns to the gods and the praises of worthy actions " could not wholly satisfy a poet whose genius was primarily and in tensely lyrical arid individual .
This latter form is akin to what obtains in the pidadeul shrines of Orissan vintage on the north - east and the phansanakara sikhara found in Gujarat and western India on the north - west of the Deccan .
The temples in Hampi and places round about , that constitute the maximum agglomeration of Vijayanagar fame , very patently exhibit this dichotomy , by their conformity with the one or the other of these two parent stocks and the most important ones of either class are noticed below and in the succeeding chapter .
But in the initial years of the nascent empire wherever faced with the challenge of raising up imposing edifices that would accord with the ambition and pride of the rising empire , the Vijayanagar architects have responded by making some bold and daring experiments and produced structures that would seem to be aberrant in the geographical and cultural context but yet exhibiting merit and fine composition .
While the former date may refer to an earlier nuclear shrine raised on the spot , the latter date would indicate that the large all - stone temple now standing over the spot was in a completed stage by that year .
Thus it would be seen that the temple was founded within a few years after the foundation of Vijayangar , the city and the empire .
The temple built in the local reddish granite is easily the largest among early Vijayanagar temples , consisting of the sanctum and axial mandapa combined into one unit .
On plan , from foundation to the aditala and mandapa prastara , it is a double apse or chapa , the two large apses meeting each other by their open ends resulting in an elliptical shape that is rather elongated .
The outer , curved apse ends face east and west respectively .
His Lord of Life is increasingly claiming His dues . " I threw my heart into this world , you picked it up and have made it your own .
But the pagan will not easily part from his Pan , the lover of life will not readily give up his many loves for the cheerless austerity of an exclusive devotion .
For sheer delight in the creation of forms , light - heartedness of mood , playfulness of thought and liveliness of language , for the exquisite frivolity of genius , Tagore never wrote anything finer , whether before or after , than the book of poems with which he closed the fortieth year of his life .
He took the liberty of using freely the colloquial language with its abbreviated sounds and drew such strength , vigour and music out of it that the experiment may be said to have revolutionised the future of Bengali poetry .
In the language of the people he found at last his own true language and made it the language of literature .
In a charming lyric he begs his " incomparable one " to forgive the frivolity of his mood and the liberties he cannot help taking with decorum , for in the season of rain when the sky pours itself out and the earth dances , how can the human heart repress its wild impulses ?
The " incomparable one " might well have been the Bengali reader , too , along with his Muse .
But this exquisite overflow of high spirits , of genial cynicism and unconcern , was itself a fleeting interludehis parting gift to the dying century to which he owed so much .
His offering to the new century was very different .
No two books of his are in sharper contrast than the two which followed each other in quick succession : Kshanika which marked the end of 1900 and Naivedya ( Offering ) which marked the beginning of 1901 .
Several of them were included later in the English Gitanjali .
The artist is subdued by the man of God and there is no room in these poems for high flights of imagination or dexterity of thought or emotional exuberance or metrical playfulness .
He has realised his own helplessness and will henceforth seek his light only from Him .
All else is because He is .
" Let Thy lamp burn in my home . Mine only heats the air and throws out foul smoke . "
He also stated in his written reply that he was totally powerless and had he not acceded to their threats they would have killed him and his queen , Zeenat Mahal : " They even declared that they would depose me and make Mirza Mughal the king .
It is a matter for patient and just consideration then , what power in any way did I possess , or what reason had I to be satisfied with them ?
I was in their power , what could I do ?
They came suddenly and made me a prisoner .
I found myself in such a predicament that I was weary of my life , while my officials had no hope of their ' s being spared .
I took nothing from them , nor did they bring any of the plunder to me .
They , one day , went to the house of the queen , Zeenat Mahal , intending to plunder it , but did not succeed in breaking open the door .
It should accordingly be considered if they were subservient to my authority .
" I did not go out in procession of my own free will .
The few servants I engaged , I engaged for the protection of my own life , in consequence of my fears of the revolted and rebellious troops .
When these troops prepared to abscond , finding an opportunity , I got away secretly under the palace windows , and went and stayed in Humayun ' s mausoleum .
From this place I was summoned with a guarantee that my life would be spared , and I at once placed myself under the protection of the government .
The mutinous troops wished to take me with them , but I would not go . "
But I have already stated that officers of the army caused whatever orders they chose to be written without my knowledge , and had them attested with my seal ; and I feel convinced that these must be of the same kind ; and that they must have compelled me to write with my hand the order they wished on Bakht Khan ' s petition , in the same way that they did in the case of every other petition . "
The . entire defence shows how weak and spineless Bahadur Shah had become at the time when he was brought to trial .
He had no strength left in him and there was no trace of the famous Mughal pride .
He was merely a puppet in the hands of the army and the officers and had no option but to sign decrees and orders as required by them .
It appears that he was solely interested in saving his own life and that of his queen ( who by that time hated him ) .
In his written statement , clearly to gain the sympathy of the court , he even said that the army alleged that he and his wife Zeenat Mahal were trying to help Englishmen .
He stated : " Moreover , they ( troopers and soldiers ) used to accuse my servants of sending letters to and of keeping in league with the English , more particularly the physicianAshan Ulla Khan , Mahbub AH Khan and the queen , Zeenat Mahal , whom they said they would kill for doing so . "
He was neither in a position nor was he advised to cross - examine any of the witnesses .
The entire evidence against him remained unquestioned and it was on the basis of the untested evidence that the Judge Advocate General secured the conviction .
The Deputy Judge Advocate General , Major F . J . Harriot , prosecutor for the government , then addressed the court .
After giving a brief history , from the time the rebellion broke till the arrest of Bahadur Shah , and summarising the evidence against the King , he categorically stated that the charges against the prisoner had been fully proved by the witnesses and documents produced before the Commission .
He said , " We stop to enquire whether it has been proved in this court , and will be repeated in after years , that the last King of the Imperial House of Taimur was an accomplice in this villainy .
These murders were committed in the broad glare of the day , before dozens of witnesses , and without the slightest attempt at concealment . They were perpetrated , as has been already stated , by the prisoner ' s own retainers , and within the limits of his palace , where , be it remembered , even under the Company ' s government , his jurisdiction was paramount .
I shall not , however , attempt to infer that these murders must have been previously sanctioned by the prisoner ; mere inference on such a point cannot be accepted in a court of justice .
He refused to hold the foreigner solely responsible for the ills of his land and said that they who inflict wrong and they who suffer it without resistance are both guilty in the eye of Heaven .
When the poet wrote this , he had no idea that within a few years this truth would be proclaimed and vindicated by Gandhi .
In a very remarkable poem written on the last day of the dying century , entitled appropriately " Sunset of the Century , " he denounced nationalism as the " Self - love of Nations " and saw in the brutality and terror of the Boer War an ominous warning of worse tragedies to follow . " The last sun of the century sets amidst the blood - red clouds of the west and the whirlwind of hatred . "
Strangely enough , it was during this period of intense religious and moral idealism that Rabindranath wrote the two novels , Nashta Nld ( The Broken Nest ) and ChokherBali ( The Eyesore ) , which laid the foundation of the realistic and psychological novel in Indian literature .
The novels written before these , whether by Bankim Chatterji or by Tagore himself , were historical romances or social melodramas or a mixture of both .
The modern novel proper , whether realistic or psychological or concerned with a problem , begins with these two in Indian literature .
The Broken Nest is the domestic tragedy of the busy editor of a daily paper who has little time to spare for his very young and romantic wife .
The bored wife seeks solace and stimulus in the company of her husband ' s young cousin , a lively and versatile youth .
They inspire and instigate each other to write and both turn out to be budding writers .
The inevitable complications arise and the happy nest is broken .
He quoted : " Mirza Mughal , his own son , and diverse other ' unknown inhabitants of Delhi and of the North - West Provinces of India ' in as much as the petition from which I am quoting , bears the autograph order of the prisoner referring to his own son Mirza Mughal and directing him quickly to send a regiment of infantry with its officers of Najafgarh . . . "
Referring to the evidence and circumstances of the prisoner having been proclaimed as King and his authority which was established on 11th May , 1858 , he said , " Mirza Mughal was publicly appointed Commander - in - Chief and a special state procession , in honour of his being so appointed , took place a few days after the outbreak . . .
Subedar Bakht Khan was appointed both Lord Governor General and Commander - in - Chief on 11th July , 1857 .
Whatever was done under the authority of these two persons were in law to have been done under the authority of the King . "
An order of the King dated 6th September , 1857 , among other documents , was read .
Who else could have given such an order . "
Some papers described as ' court - diary ' were relied upon to prove that 49 Europeans were murdered with the consent of the King .
Forty - nine Britishers were prisoners and the army demanded that they should be given over to them for slaughter .
The King delivered them by saying , ' The army may do as they please ' , and the prisoners were consequently put to the sword .
He also relied upon certain circulars purported to have been sent to the ruler of Kutch , chief of Jaisalmer and the ruler of Jammu . "
About the knowledge of the King in helping and encouraging the mutineers of the 11th and 20th Regiments of the Native Infantry , the Deputy Judge Advocate General said : " We have evidence that the mutineers of the 11th and 20th Regiments of Native Infantry , before the Magazine was exploded , proceeded to attack and escalate it , and it is then for the first time that we find the King , through his troops , acting in open alliance with these traitors to their government .
From that moment there is no further disguise and no attempt at concealment .
After the speech of the Deputy Judge Advocate General , the court adjourned to consider and arrive at its findings .
When the court reassembled , on 9th March , 1858 , it pronounced its judgment : " The court , on the evidence before them , are of the opinion that the prisoner , Muhammad Bahadur Shah , ex - King of Delhi , is guilty of all and every part of the charges preferred against him . "
This verdict was approved and confirmed by Major General N . P . Penny , commanding the Meerut Division on 2nd April , 1858 at Camp Saharun ; and the court was adjourned sine die .
Bahadur Shah has been criticised by many writers for accepting the trial .
He was not a British subject , therefore there was no justification for the British Government to try him before the Tribunal .
The problem analysed in Chokher Bali , which is a fuller and a better constructed novel , is posed in a more complex setting .
The story revolves round the dilemma of human relationship and describes what takes place behind the staid facade of a well - to - do , middle - class Bengali home of the period where a widowed mother lives with her only son on whom she dotes .
One would imagine that nothing much ever happen in a home like that with its numerous inhibitions and restricted social contacts , and in fact nothing happens that may not happen in any Indian home .
And yet passions , savage and violent , are unleashed within hearts seemingly placid , and battles rage until the home is nearly burnt down without flame or smoke being visible to the outside eye .
Altogether the first year of the present century is a very significant year in Tagore ' s life , fruitful in every respect , from the point of view of his literary achievement , his spiritual development , his public commitments and his struggles as a man . The year marks the end of his freedom as an individual owing no obligations save to his Muse and to his family .
The lover will become a teacher and the poet will don the robes of a prophet .
All he knew was that he could no longer continue looking exclusively after the family estates , that destiny was calling him to a larger field of activity .
Life in Calcutta with its incessant clamour and distractions was too noisy and distasteful .
He needed proximity to nature and earth , he needed quiet for his work and he needed activity to fill the leisure between writing .
What better place than Santiniketan to suit all his requirements ?
" Upon the basis of that statement in the Brahmo Public Opinion , without informing yourself whether it was true or false , and without ever making enquiry into the cirumstances of the case , you proceeded recklessly to comment upon the conduct of the judge and to hold him up to public execration .
" Now so far from there being the least foundation for this tissue of abuse , it appears from the affidavits upon which this rule was issued ( which are now admitted by yourself to be perfectly correct ) , that the account given in the Brahtno Public Opinion and your own comments upon it , were wholly without foundation .
" It may be perfectly true that European judges and more especially barrister judges , are often imperfectly acquainted with the religious views and feelings of the Hindu community , and the utmost they can do , when occasion arises , is to consult those who are best informed upon the subject and to be guided by their advice .
" But we now understand from your own affidavit , as well as from your counsel , Mr Banerjea , that you admit that the learned judge did everything in his power , to ascertain the truth of the matter , and to avoid giving the least offence to the religious feelings of your countrymen .
" It therefore only remains for us to consider what punishment we ought to inflict upon you .
" It is , indeed , a very lamentable thing , and I trust that your own countrymen will also be of that opinion , to find a gentleman of your position and attainments , who was once a member of the coveted Civil Service and is now an honorary magistrate of this city , making use of his influence as a newspaper editor to vilify and bring into public contempt , without any justification whatever , a judge of the High Court .
You profess in your affidavit to justify your offence by putting forward as the basis of your false charges against Mr Justice Norris , a statement in the Brahmo Public Opinion which you say you believed to be true and upon which you considered yourself at liberty to enlarge and comment with extreme severity .
" Moreover , whilst you profess to admit that your charges were totally false and unfounded , and made without any sort of enquiry on your part , you still maintain that you made them in perfect good faith , and in the interests of the public good .
" Furthermore , you have made mention in your affidavit of another article , extracted from the Brahmo Public Opinion , which is also apparently intended to reflect upon Mr Justice Norris , and the subject of which has nothing to do with the present proceedings .
An English judge was sacrosanct : above law , above criticism .
Ramcoomar Dey was discharged without any punishment .
Justice Mitter , who had the rare courage to dissent , did not agree with the majority opinion and the sentence awarded .
He opposed such severe punishment in a case of this nature .
Chief Justice did not like this and said : " . . . that the majority of the court regret that in determining the award of punishment , my brother Mitter ' s views should not be in accordance with theirs .
We are , of course , fully aware of the proceedings to which that the learned judge refers , but in the first place , we think , the facts of that case are very different from the present and in the next place , we find ample precedent in England and in this case of libel where a more severe punishment has been awarded . "
Though the affidavit filed by Surendra Nath Banerjea was clear and unequivocal , still , the judges were bent upon teaching a lesson and characterised the affidavit as lacking in honesty and candour .
It was well known that Surendra Nath Banerjea was not only a great orator and politician , but a man of great learning and master of English language .
He was fully advised by his counsel and there was nothing vague in his affidavit .
Still the Chief Justice observed , to justify the punishment :
If after what you have heard , you state that , upon reflection you find that the charges which you made against Mr Justice Dwarkanath Mitter were unwarranted and wholly without foundation , and that you are sorry for having made them , you may do so , and you may add , if you wish it , either that you did not intend to cast any reflection upon any of the other judges , or that the reflection cast was unfounded , and if you publish that apology in The Englishman , you may apply , on Monday the 3rd day of May next , for your discharge on payment of the fine ' .
" This sentence was passed on Saturday the 24th April , 1869 , and on the 27th April the following Mr Taylor , having made a suitable apology , was released , the remaining term of his imprisonment having been remitted .
The complexion of guilt in the case of Mr Taylor is certainly not of a lighter character than that of Surendra Nath Banerjea .
On the 18th July , 1893 , Justice B . Peacock observed that after carefully examining the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure , 1882 , which came into force in January , 1883 , they were clearly of the opinion that notwithstanding the Code , the High Court had jurisdiction to commit the petitioner for a contempt of court in publishing the libel set out in the petition .
In 1898 Rabindranath had taken his wife and five children , three daughters and two sons , to his estate in Shelidah and had taken in his own hands their education .
But teaching one ' s children haphazardly is not enough ; he needed a wider field for systematic experimentation and he thought , Why not shift to Santiniketan and start a small experimental school there ?
His imagination had already been caught by idealised pictures of tapovana or forest hermitages in ancient India where learned sages lived with their disciples and taught them the practice of simple living and high thinking .
He would thus revive the ancient ideal and replace the soulless and mechanical system of education which the British rulers had imported from their Victorian slums by a new and creative one in which both teaching and learning would be pleasurable .
He would combine the ancient spirit with the modern setting and recast the old in a new mould .
On 22 December 1901 he inaugurated his school at Santiniketan , with five pupils , among them his eldest son , and with as many teachers .
He named it Brahmacharya Asrama , after the ancient forest hermitages .
The orthodox Hindu must have squirmed at this sacrilege , for of the five teachers three were Christians , one an Englishman , his son ' s previous tutor .
But that was always Tagore ' s wayto interpret tradition in his own fashion , to honour the dead on his own terms .
Their sentences were accordingly reduced from death to transportation for life .
Their Lordships delivered separate judgments .
They agreed in acquitting B . H . Kane .
With regard to 12 others , viz . Barindra , Ullaskar , Upendra , Hem Das , Indra Rai , Sishir , Proesh , Bibhuti , Nirapada , Abinash , Sudhir , and Harishikesh , they upheld their convictions under Section 121 - A , but their sentences were reduced .
Regarding five others - Sailendra , Krishna Jiban , Biren Sen , Sushil Sen and Indra Nandy - the Chief Justice was for acquittal , but Justice Garnduff was for upholding their convictions under Section 121 - A .
The commital proceedings before the magistrate , Mr Birley , occupied 76 days .
The trial in the Court of Sessions lasted 131 days .
The appeal in the High Court was heard for 47 days .
The two judges disagreed and the reference by a third judge was heard for 20 days .
The mass of documents filed , if counted individually , were over four thousand pages and the material and articles exhibited , i . e . bombs , tools , revolvers , etc . were between three to four hundred . 2 .
The approver , Narendranath Gossain , was murdered in jail ( before he had completed his examination in the magistrate ' s court ) by two of the accused undertrials , both of whom were hanged .
The prosecution consequently lost its evidence at Sessions .
Banerjee , a police officer , was shot before he could be called as a witness and his murderer was never discovered .
The most dramatic event was the murder of Babu Ashutosh Biswas , the public prosecutor , who , one afternoon , was conducting the prosecution during the absence from court of Mr Norton .
He was shot in the back in the immediate vicinity of the Sessions Court by a young man who forfeited his life in return at the gallows . 3 .
Mr Norton was allowed to keep a loaded pistol in his brief throughout the trial . 4 .
In London , Savarkar gathered around him a number of Indian students who procured a book on bomb - making and sent cyclostyled copies of it to India .
This was followed by transportation of Madanlal Dhingra of Savarkar ' s group , for killing Curzon Wyllie with a bomb in London ,
Meanwhile , revolutionaries in India became very active .
In 1910 , Kanhere shot the Collector of Nasik to avenge the transportation of his brother .
From the steamer in which he was being taken , he escaped through a pothole and landed on French soil near Marseilles ; but , he was captured by his guards .
Brought back to India , he was tried by a Special Tribunal on charges of treason .
On the first day of July , 1910 the steamer " S . S . MOREA " , carrying Savarkar to India , started on her historic voyage from London .
There were strong security arrangements on the ship .
" S . S . MOREA " developed some engine trouble and was forced to anchor at Marseilles on the evening of 7th July , 1910 .
The task was not only dangerous but perilous and Savarkar used his uncanny intelligence and ingenuity .
He opened fire on the escaping prisoner .
Pursuers came running after him , shouting , " Catch the thief , " and Savarkar was forcibly grabbed away by them from the French policeman , contrary to rules of International Law .
It was unfortunate that Savarkar ' s colleagues , who were planning his rescue , were late by a few hours .
The news of Savarkar ' s daring but unsuccessful attempt to escape on 8th July , 1910 shook the conscience of the world .
The ship sailed for India and reached Aden where Savarkar was transferred to another steamer , " S S . SASTI " , under heavy security .
The guards huddled him into a tiny cabin , only a space of four feet square , which allowed him to stand only ; not to move or walk .
Handcuffed and guarded , Savarkar braved the circumstances , to reach India , with undaunted spirit .
He The " S . S . SASTI " reached Bombay without any mishap .
On 22nd July , 1910 , the prince of Indian revolutionaries , Savarkar , was received at the Bombay harbour in a befitting manner .
A closed motor van transferred him to a well guarded special train which delivered him to the Nasik police custody .
She grumbled only when he came in the way of her dressing her children in fine clothes .
Nor did she remain unlettered for long .
She soon acquired proficiency not only in her own language but in English and Sanskrit as well .
At her husband ' s persuasion she translated into Bengali an abridged version of the Ramayana from the original Sanskrit .
She also acted on the stage in his play Raja O Rani and gave an excellent interpretation of the role sho was assigned .
No wonder then that she won her husband ' s heart in the end , who gave ample proof of his devotion when she took to bed .
There were no electric fans in those days and contemporary witnesses have left on record their admiration of the husband who was always at trie bedside , his hand - fan moving gently over her .
When she died he spent the whole night on the terrace walking up and down , having given strict orders that no one was to disturb him .
The fact that he was brought to India on an illegal warrant was not a point of consideration for them .
The Special Tribunal passed judgment on a man whose case was subjudice in the International Court of Arbitration at The Hague .
In a country ruled by imperialism , justice also assumes an imperious face and imperils truth .
It is significant to note that not content with the order of transportation for Savarkar , the Indian Government of Lord Sydenham instituted a second case against him .
This time charging him with abetment of the murder of Mr Jackson , the Collector of Nasik .
The very same Special Tribunal was asked to try him .
The show was again enacted .
Mahatma Gandhi and Shankerlal Banker , publisher of young India , were tried and convicted in 1922 under Section 124 - A of the Indian Penal Code for writing four inflammatory articles against the British in " Young India .
This was the first trial of its kind where legality and morality of the Indian non - co - operation movement was involved .
The Hon ' ble Chief Justice , J . M . Shelat , of the Gujarat High Court , described the trial thus :
" Barring the trial of Socrates , there is perhaps no trial in the history of mankind comparable to that of Gandhiji which stimulated so much interest and whose influence on the life of humanity has been so profound .
" The similarity of attitudes adopted by Socrates and Gandhiji towards the Tribunals which tried them is at once manifest , for , each placed truth above law and sought the punishment which the breach of the law warranted . "
The trial of Gandhiji is similar to that of Socrates , because it concerns itself with the conflict between the issue of allegiance to the State on the one hand and on the other , with duty and morality as the person concerned believes in .
The Governor - in - Council on 4th March , 1922 had passed the following order sanctioning prosecution against Gandhiji and his publisher , Shankerlal Ghelabhai Banker . " In pursuance of the provisions of Section 196 of the Criminal Procedure Code , 1898 , the Governor - in - Council hereby authorises Daniel Healy , District Superintendent of Police , Ahmedabad , to lodge a complaint under Section 124 - A of the Indian Penal Code , 1860 , against Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Shankerlal Ghelabhai Banker , editor and printer respectively , of the Young India newspaper , printed and published at Ahmedabad in respect of the following articles which appeared in the issues of the said newspaper specified below : S . No .
Articles Date of issue in which it appeared 1 .
Disaffection - a Virtue 15th June , 1921 2 .
Tampering with Loyalty 29th September , 1921 3 .
A Puzzle and its Solution 15th December , 1921 4 .
Shaking the Manes 23rd February , 1922 Mahatma Gandhi and Shankerlal Banker were arrested and produced before Mr L . N . Brown , Additional District Magistrate of Ahmedabad on 11th March , 1922 .
When in the court ( in case No . 1 of 1922 ) , Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi , aged 53 , caste : Hindu Banya , occuption : farmer and weaver , having residence at Ashram Sabarmati and Shankerlal Ghelabhai Banker ; aged 32 , caste : Hindu Banya , occupation : landed proprietor , having residence at Chowpaly , Bombay were brought for trial under Section 124 - A l . P . C . at 11 a . m . , evidence was led by prosecution in support of the charges , before the magistrate , where the accused , Mahatma Gandhi stated :
" My name is Mohandas .
My father ' s name is Karamchand Gandhi .
My age is about 53 years .
I am by caste Hindu Banya .
My occupation is farmer and weaver .
" Q . The evidence has been given in your hearing .
Do you wish to make any remarks about it ?
" And I hereby direct that you be tried by the said court on the said charge .
" I have therefore no alternative but to commit them to the Court of Sessions for trial , the offence appearing too serious for me to dispose of the case myself . "
The case was committed to the Court of Sessions , Ahmedabad on the plea of ' guilty ' under Section 124 - A of the Indian Penal Code .
Gandhiji and Banker were then removed to Sabarmati The trial aroused wide interest and attracted spectators from all over India .
The personality of the accused at the Bar of the court , his profound impact on the world both as a saint and a teacher , the nature of the offence with which he was indicted , the issues involved in the trial , the political situation prevalent in the country and the possible repercussions of his convictions on the future course of events in India , all conspired to make the trial momentous and historic .
The trial began at 12 o ' clock before R . S . Broomfield Esquire , I . C . S . , Sessions Judge .
At five minutes to twelve , the accused were brought in custody in the court .
Nevertheless , the entire court rose in an act of spontaneous homage when Mahatma Gandhi entered - a frail , serene , indomitable figure in a coarse and scanty loin - cloth , accompanied by his devoted disciples and fellow - prisoner , Shankerlal Banker .
" So you are seated near me to give me your support in case I break down he jested with that happy laugh of his , which seems to hold all the undimmed radiance of the world ' s childhood in its depths .
In the same number was another article , dated 28th July , 1921 , in which it was stated that ' we have to destroy the system ' .
Again on 30th September , 1921 another article under ' Punjab Prosecution ' stated that ' a non - co - operator worth his name should preach disaffection ' .
They were earlier in date than the article ' Tampering with Loyalty ' , and it was referred to by the Government of Bombay .
The Advocate General however added that the accused was a man of high educational qualifications and from his writings an acknowledged leader . Thus the harm that was likely to be caused was greater . because the writings were by an educated man and not by some obscure man .
He asked the court to consider the nature of the campaign proposed in the writings and their repercussions which became apparent last November , both in Bombay and Chauri Chaura .
There were murders and destruction of property , inflicting misery and misfortune on many people .
The Advocate General admitted that though non - violence was preached in the articles , what was its use when Gandhi preached disaffection towards the government , or openly instigated others to overthrow it .
The most unhappy man present there was , perhaps , the judge himself .
He restrained his emotions , cleared his voice , gathered his strength and delivered his oral judgment in careful and dignified words .
Few readers would normally suspect that Tagore ' s poems on children so full of innocent delight were written during a period of great dejection and anxiety .
He had not only to nurse the ailing daughter but to look after and entertain the two youngest ones who , in the absence of the mother , clung to him .
For their sake he had to hide his own grief and anxiety and to share their little interests and listen to their prattle .
On the seashore of endless worlds is the great meeting of children . "
In September 1903 , nine months after her mother ' s death , Renuka died , at the age of thirteen .
This precocious , moody and uncommon girl was very dear to the father who felt her loss deeply , though he gave no expression to his grief .
He buried himself in his work and continued to fill the pages of his literary journal , Bangadarshan .
Though the possibility of launching a big conspiracy case against the prominent left - wing leaders was being considered from 1927 , the first concrete reference to it is found in Lord Irwin ' s secret telegram to the Secretary of State for India on 13th September , 1928 .
At the time the Public Safety Bill was making a difficult and painfully slow progress in the Legislative Assembly , to which the Viceroy referred as such :
Arrests On 14th March , the vicerory s Council sanctioned the arrest of thirty - one leftist leaders with the charge of having , " entered into a conspiracy to deprive the King of the . sovereignty of British India , and having thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 121 - A of l . P . C . "
Under Section 196 of Criminal Penal Code , 1898 , Mr M . A . Horton , Officer - on - Special Duty in the Intelligence Bureau , filed a complaint in the court of the District Magistrate at Meerut .
Among the thirty - one accused leftists were , apart from the two British nationals , Spratt and Bradley , well - known Indian communists like P . C . Joshi and S . A . Dange .
On 20th March , 1929 large - scale arrests were carried out simultaneously in half a dozen different towns .
The news of the arrest created a stir in the country .
Dr Dharamvir Singh , stated that he had never been a communist and as a follower of Gandhi was opposed to communist objectives and methods .
S . H . Jhabwalla argued that he was a Tarsi humanitarian ' , while Alve claimed himself to be an ' agriculturist and a labourer ' .
The first phase of the Meerut conspiracy case , the magistrate enquiry , ended on 15th December , 1929 after lasting for about seven months .
On 13th January , 1930 , thirty - one out of the thirty - two accused were committed to trial by Mr Milner White .
All the prisoners except Dr Dharamvir Singh were committed to be tried by the court of Special Sessions , Merrut .
M . N . Roy , who was not arrested at that time , was tried separately .
The first application in this respect was made to the Chief Justice in Allahabad on 16th July , 1929 .
He rejected it saying that the trial was being conducted under conditions " most normal in this country " , that he did not believe there was any inconvenience and that " everybody will settle down comfortably at Meerut . "
The final application for transfer was moved on 24th January , 1930 by Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru .
He appealed to the Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court , on behalf of the thirty - one accused that their case should be transferred to Allahabad High Court and their trial be held before a jury .
On 27th January , 1930 the Chief Justice dismissed the application and ordered the case to proceed in the Meerut Sessions Court .
In doing so he observed that a jury might not take a judicial view .
He further stated that he was not " in favour of a jury trial since a jury would be asked to follow and to understand a very large number of documents . . . a super - human task to ask any member of the jury .
Consequently , " he concluded , " the only man who could give a fair and just decision on a matter of this kind was a single judge . "
The second phase of the conspiracy case , the formal trial , began before R . L . Yorke and five Indian assessors in the court of Special Sessions at Meerut on 31st January , 1930 .
The prosecution rested its case on 17th March , 1931 after examining 281 witnesses and producing 2,600 documents .
This was followed by the rendering of the formal statements of the prisoners and the presentation of the official defence of the accused .
The trial reached its closing phase on 16th June , 1932 when the special prosecutor for the Crown , Mr M . L . Kemp , delivered a long closing statement , lasting almost two months .
Conclusion The Meerut trial was from the very beginning a political case .
As the trial proceeded , it assumed a propagandist character on both sides .
This trend was set in motion by the chief prosecution counsel , Mr Langford James , who vehemently attacked communism , national and international , in the choicest phraseology , characterising the communists as enemies of civilised life .
The defendants in their turn seized the opportunity to make political speeches and propaganda statements from the court .
Most of the accused , particularly the communists , had decided to make such statements as would help publicise the ideology and the programme of the Communist Party .
To this end each of the accused delivered an individual statement of defence followed by joint statement .
" The Meerut trial belongs to the class of cases of which the Mooney trial and Sacco Vanzetli trial in America , the Dreyfus trial in France , the Reichtag Fire trial in Germany are the supreme instances . "
A mammoth procession led by Lala Lajpat Rai greeted it with black flags and was lathi - charged by the police .
Bhagat Singh , Rajguru and Azad decided to kill Mr Scott as he was suspected to be responsible for ' the lathi ' blows on Lajpat Rai .
Taking him for Scott , they shot dead Assistant Superintendent of Police , Mr J . P . Saunders , on 17th December , 1928 .
On 8th April , 1929 Bhagat Singh and his accomplice B . K . Dutt threw a bomb when the Central Assembly was in session , and later offered themselves for arrest shouting 1n - cjuilab Zindabad ' ( Long Live the Revolution ) .
Innumerable songs grew about him and the popularity that the man achieved , was something amazing . "
Bhagat Singh ' s throwing of a bomb in the Central Assembly and his revolutionary activities aroused equally powerful feelings against the British rule as much as those aroused by the non - resistance movement and the peaceful satyagraha .
It was not a difficult task for Bhagat Singh and B . K . Dutt to dodge the usual vigil of the police after throwing the bombs in the Central Hall of the Assembly . But , a decision not to run away had already been taken .
Both dauntless heroes stood like a rock at their places to court arrest .
After raising revolutionary slogans and throwing leaflets in the Central Hall , both the accused courted arrest at the hands of the police .
This gesture , which proved ' suicidal ' for them in course of time , had a deep hidden meaning - message for the nation and the world , an expression of deep resentment and dissatisfaction against the existing repression by the Raj .
Both were kept in solitary confinement and under strict security .
The British Government not wanting to take any chance , sent the summons to the accused in jail .
On the day of hearing elaborate security arrangements were made .
The newspaper , The Hindustan Times , reported :
" Police constables with lathis were lined from the magistrate ' s residence on the Rajpur Road to the jail and all other roads leading to the jail .
C . I . D . men in plain clothes were seen cycling on the roads as well as watching all important crossings .
I find that by doing so , he did cause hurt to Sir George Sanchuster , Mr R . P . Rao and Mr Shankar Rao .
These facts constitute an offence punishable under Section 308 of I . P . C . with transportation for life or with lesser punishment .
" The same acts include the causing of explosion of a nature likely to endanger life , unlawfully and maliciously , which constitute an offence punishable under Section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act , 1908 .
" I find it proved that Dutt threw the second bomb with similar intention and that by doing so he caused hurt to Mr S . N . Roy and Rai Bahadur A . P . Dube .
" 1 find both the accused guilty of both the offences with which they are charged and convict them accordingly . "
" The acts of each accused constitute offences punishable under two different provisions of law .
One offence is included in the other , under the provisions of Section 71 of the Indian Penal Code : the punishment , which may be inflicted , is not to be more severe than could be awarded for any one of such offences .
That decision was , thus , communicated to the Central Government by the government of Punjab through a telegram :
" Bhagat Singh , Rajguru and Sukhdev will be executed at 7 on the evening of March , 23rd .
The news will be made known in Lahore on the early morning of March , 24 . "
They were duly hanged by neck in the dark of the night and an announcement was made :
" The public are hereby informed that the dead bodies of Bhagat Singh , Rajguru and Sukhdev , who were hanged yesterday evening ( March , 23rd ) were taken out of the jail to the bank of the Sutlej where they were cremated according to Sikh and Hindu rites and their remains were also thrown into the river . "
This happened when the Labour Government was in power in Great Britain .
The Daily Worker of New York commented :
" The three Lahore prisoners , Bhagat Singh , Rajguru and Sukhdev , fighters for the independence of India , have been executed by the British Labour Government in the interest of British imperialism .
This is one of the bloodiest deeds ever undertaken by the British Labour Government , under the leadership of R . MacDonald .
The execution of the three Indian revolutionaries on the deliberate political frame - up on the orders of the Labour Government shows the length to which the MacDonald regime will go to save British imperialism . "
In the year 1915 , he left India and visited Indonesia , Malaysia , China , Japan and the USA before reaching Berlin in 1916 .
He was in the USA from 1916 to 1917 .
He became a member of the Mexican Socialist Party - the first communist party outside Russia .
He went to Spain , Berlin and Moscow and met Lenin in 1920 .
He was an active member of the Second Congress of Communist International Conference and was a member of the Marxist bureau .
He was an intellectual , a prolific writer and wrote several books on Marxism , revolution , Renaissance , science , history , etc . from 1927 onwards .
In 1930 he returned to India and was arrested in 1931 .
He was sentenced to 12 years ' imprisonment in 1932 which was later reduced to 6 years by the Appeal Court .
He spent 5 years in British jails .
Kanpur had been selected originally as venue of the trial to avoid jury trial and demonstrations .
He was first produced before the magistrate who committed him to stand trial before the Sessions .
The charge - sheet was prepared by Lieutenant - Colonel Cecil Kaye who was head of the anti - Bolshevik bureau in the British Intelligence Service , The case started with Mr Rose - Alston , chief counsel for the prosecution , reading the charges to the court .
The charges framed were as follows :
organisation , known as the Communist International ; that a section of the said organisation , acting
side British India , communicated with each other and with others and entered into a conspiracy to establish the said branch organisation throughout British India with the aforesaid object , that is to say , to deprive the King Emperor of the sover -
He said , " The immediate and potential dangers of the communist movement in India even as an isolated factor are sufficiently obvious .
On the one hand , there have been communications with the representatives of the old Bengal revolutionaries , many of whom are personal friends of M . N . Roy and who , since the failure of the non - co - operation movement , have been moving towards resumption of their former activities .
Between these two groups , Roy ' s communists occupy a dangerously convenient yet tactical position . "
In May 1924 , the Session Judge at Kanpur had sentenced four of the accused - Dange , Usmani , N . B , Das Gupta and Muzaffar Ahmad - to four years ' rigorous imprisonment while charges against Roy were kept pending .
Roy could not be arrested at that time but he was in constant touch .
At the Kanpur trial , he wanted the communists to utilise the court - room proceedings to propagate the main tenets of communism and spell out the immediate programme of the Indian communist movement , so that it should gain wide publicity .
But the accused , unfortunately on the advice of their lawyers , took a narrow legalistic stand and missed this grand opportunity ( a mistake that was amply rectified during the Meerut trial ) .
M . N . Roy was very disappointed and in a letter to a friend in India , in November 1924 , wrote :
" Poor fellows , if they could only have put up a better defence , four years in jail would have been worthwhile . "
The learned judge of the High Court discussed the evidence upon which the conviction was based and which was almost entirely documentary .
The evidence consisted of :
a ) letters form M . N . Roy and his associates in India and letters from them to him .
These were original letters which were intercepted and retained or found in possession of M . N . Roy and associates when they were arrested ;
The judge said :
" Various technical legal objections were taken by the learned counsel , Dr K . N . Katju , in the appeal .
It was argued that the Sessions Court in Kanpur had no jurisdiction to try Roy , that he was not legally committed as no proper and legal regular charges under Section 121 - A of the Penal Code were framed and he was convicted upon the evidence which was irrelevant and incompetent . "
The learned judge , after fully considering the submissions , held :
I joined it because I wanted freedom for my motherland and was - ready to shed my blood for it .
I took part in this fight as a member of the regularly organised fighting forces of independent Provisional Government of Free India , which fought according to the rules of civilised warfare for the liberation of my motherland from foreign rule .
I claim that in doing so I committed no offence . On the other hand , I have served my country to the best of my ability . "
Lt . G . S . Dhillon too challenged the authority of the court to try him .
He also narrated how he came to join the I . N . A . and said , " Whatever I did , as the member of a regularly organised force fighting under the Provisional Government of Free India and am , therefore , not liable to be charged with or tried under the Indian Army Act or the criminal law of India for any offence on account of any act done by me in the discharge of my duties as a member of such force .
I am further advised that in point of law my trial by court martial is illegal . "
Though there were 16 advocates in the court , including Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru , the defence was led by Bhulabhai J . Desai , whose brilliance in cross - examination was revealed when he submitted : " The proposition is this that in view of the fact that a state of war existed between the Provisional " Government of Azad Hind and the British , and acts done in prosecution of that war had not " In International Law it is permissible for those who are subject to a foreign authority to organise themselves and having an organised army to fight for liberation , whether it is successful or not .
During the process , while the war is being carried on , there is immunity so far as individual members of the organised army are concerned , for all acts done in due prosecution of war on a civilised basis ( other than war crimes like those which are the subject of trial now in different parts of the world ) .
That being so , my submission is that the accused men before you are entitled to be declared innocent , in that there is no civil or criminal responsibility for those acts .
As such , an army and individual members of such an army so organised were not answerable before any municipal court - for what was done in due prosecution of that war for liberation of their country .
The prosecutor had tendered a considerable body of evidence to prove the formation of the Provisional Government of Free India , the raising of armed forces by it , and the putting of those armed forces in the field against the British .
These soldiers , therefore , though normally said to be fighting against the King were really fighting to liberate their own country .
Bhulabhai Desai brilliantly analysed the evidence led by the prosecution regarding each case of alleged murder and torture .
He forcefully submitted that the evidence was totally irrelevant for the purpose of the case for the reasons that the grounds on which that evidence was attempted to be led was entirely non - existent .
He further submitted that the evidence with reference to the alleged charges of murder would be covered by his first submission that they were part of the prosecution by the army ; that those people were sentenced by court martial to be shot under proper law .
He further submitted that there was an organised government , that there were a large number of Indians in the Far East owing allegiance to this government , which was recognised as a government having been ceded to its territories .
It was by this government that war was declared and the Indian National Army fought the war .
It must be said that the trial was conducted with fairness which proved a fitting finale to the British Raj . It also proved the fairness of British justice . It was held at a place convenient for all .
The Red Fort was not only convenient for the British Raj as it was the army headquarters , it was equally convenient for every politician and lawyer in India .
The trial was conducted when opinion in India was very much against it .
So much so , that Sir George Cunningham , the Governer of North - West Frontier Province , went out of his way to write to the Viceroy , Lord Wayell advising him that the Commander - in - Chief should at once announce that as Indian opinion is opposed to the trial of these persons no further proceedings should be taken .
The trial did much good in further arousing national consciousness among Indians but did a lot of harm to the cause of the British Empire .
An explosive situation was saved by the Commander - in - Chief when he commuted the sentence of the three officers .
Had the sentence passed by the court been carried out against strong public opinion , it would have created chaos in the country at that time .
Shri M . C . Setalvad , India ' s foremost jurist , in his introduction to the I . N . A . trial , summed up the defects and effects of the trial and also the forensic ability of Shri Bhulabhai Desai in the following words :
It was the occasion of a debate on far - reaching and , in some respects , altogether novel propositions of International Law , a subject of lasting interest to lawyers and those interested in law .
To the ordinary citizen it was the fascinating and inspiring story of a heroic effort - the most famous in Indian history of a great Indian patriot , supported by thousands of his countrymen , to liberate their country .
We declare to the world that this sale deed confers no privileges equivalent to those claimed by States governed by treaty rights .
We wish to declare that no sale deed however sacrosanct can condemn more than four million men and women to servitude of an autocrat when the will to live under this rule is no longer there .
The people of Kashmir are determined to mould their own destiny and we appeal to Mission to recognise justice and strength of our cause . "
This telegram was ignored and when in 1946 , it became clear that the British Government was handing over the reigns of administration in British provinces to the Indian National Congress without doing anything about the princely States , Sheikh Abdullah intensified the freedom campaign in Kashmir .
He made powerful political speeches , the theme of which was that the Amritsar Treaty was not binding on the people of Kashmir because it was a treaty of servitude .
Like Mahatma Gandhi , he too gave a call for ' Quit Kashmir ' .
He made several such speeches during May , 1946 in this connection which alarmed Maharaja Hari Singh .
The people of Kashmir soon rose in support of the Sheikh in his move against misrule and exploitation of the people by the Maharaja and his Prime Minister .
In a letter dated 18th June , 1946 Maharaja Hari Singh wrote thus to ' a senior British official in Delhi :
Now every person is entitled to freedom .
" This deed of sale has ruined our people .
You should say ' Quit Kashmir ' .
Revoke the deed of sale .
We wish to tell the British that Maharaja Hari Singh has no right to rule over this country .
One wholesaler purchased and passed us on to retailers . ( 10th May , 1946 ) .
It is your duty to invite everybody and declare that we have to win independence from the Dogra Shahi even at the cost of our lives , wealth and health .
There would be no better time to put an end to the Dogra Shahi . " b ) That on the 14th May , 1946 in connection with his previous speeches , he made a speech in which the following passages occur : " Till now efforts have been made by diverse means to suppress my voice .
I told Maharaja Hari Singh with utmost respect that it would have been better for you to improve the condition of the poor rather than waste crores of rupees on your own luxuries .
After a hundred years of misrule , we say that we have never accepted nor will accept this rule .
For this right , we will have to make supreme sacrifice .
After a hundred years , we will not remain slaves of the Dogra Shahi even for one day .
" Make preparation , you are the harbinger of the voice thereby breaking the shackles of slavery .
( Fitzgerald J . in ( 1868 ) 11 Cox . C . C . 54 at page 55 ) .
Asaf Ali said that to raise voice against oppression and demand the fundamental right to live did not amount to sedition .
About the nature of the Treaty of Amritsar , he said : " I tried to make it perfectly clear that in the text of that speech it is amply clear that a certain historical controversy had been started by Mr Potedar , and the extensive reference to the Treaty of Amritsar , its origin , and the consequences which flowed from it , were really nothing more than a mere reply to Mr Fotedar ' s contention .
As occasion had arisen for a speech like that because this controversy had been raised , otherwise I am perfectly certain that the historical details prior to the conclusion of the Treaty of Amritsar may not have been considered at such great length by the speaker . "
It is more so when you are translating a speech when it is being delivered by a On the capability of the translatators , he said : " Now , Sir , you have also to consider the education and experience of these C . I . D . reporters .
One is not even a graduate , though the other is .
Whatever may be their capacity for reporting , it is impossible for them to reproduce the effect of the original .
It is very doubtful whether the words and sentences reported by these reporters , for which the subject matter of the present charge and the words and sentences uttered by the speaker , have been mutilated and misquoted . "
Justifying what the Sheikh said , Asaf Ali submitted : " The accused pointed out the misery and poverty of the people more or less in the same manner and spirit as did His Highness in the above statement .
And he was quite correct in saying that the people of the State were slaves of slaves .
There is nothing wrong or seditious about it .
" Obviously the speaker meant that while the mass of the population was seeped in poverty , the administration was not doing all it could do for the people , "
Asaf Ali warned the court of the consequences that would follow if leaders like Sheikh were convicted under such law .
He said , " In conclusion , I must request you to bear in mind what I am about to say with all the sense of responsibility and gravity of which I am capable .
Every time you deal with them under the Section , instead of remedying the evil you increase its dimensions , because the conviction of such popular leaders leads to movements which have very far - reaching repercussions .
After the arrest of the Congress Working Committee members in 1942 , everywhere you saw ' Quit India ' inscribed in the unlikeliest places in public places , on public buildings , ' in trains , in press - rooms , and even in barracks and schools .
In reply to the speech of the Assistant Advocate General , Asaf Ali said : " The learned Assistant Advocate General appeared to have a very queer notion of democracy and full responsible government and the length to which he went in trying to ridicule both , and also the light - hearted manner in which he tried to prove that responsible government is no better than autocracy , proved that he was wholly innocent of even the rudimentary conception of the constitutional theory of democracy .
He even went to the length of saying that in a democratic government only a few persons whose lust for power is not satisfied desire to exploit the democratic electoral system , and he saw no logic in asserting that the majority is wiser than the minority .
It would not be worth my while to read to the Assistant Advocate General a lesson in constitutional law and to prove to him that the logic of the inherent sanction of the majority is irrefutable and the fear of a revolutionary upheaval against the rule of a minority , whether consisting of many or of one , is the basis of democracy and of a secure and stable government . "
The Assistant Advocate General had justified the purchase of Kashmir under the Treaty of Amritsar by quoting instances to which Asaf AH replied : " The Assistant Advocate General then passed on to a disquisition on what he imagined were principles of the International Law of today and inspite of the court ' s hints intended to restrain him , he took nearly an hour or longer reading from Historian ' s History of World and Hall ' s International Law .
" He further claimed that the right of conquest did not admit of the recognition of the wishes of the people of the conquered territory and so on .
By doing all this he was justifying both the sale deed of Kashmir , otherwise known as the Treaty of Amritsar , as he was also claiming that of the ruling by conquest .
All this was intended to prove that the people had no right to demand or claim responsible government on the basis of the inherent right of the people ' s sovereignty .
I was delighted , for the whole of my case was that the speaker had complained against the treatment of the people of Kashmir as bought slaves ' and had maintained that this hurt the human dignity and self - respect of the four million people of Kashmir , and , therefore , the relations between the ruler and the ruled should rest not on such claims and titles , but on the goodwill and the affection of the people . "
However , the Sheikh ' s profound statement and Asaf Ali ' s incisive speech made no impact on the court which , as predetermined , convicted Sheikh Abdullah .
A recent survey indicates that the number of two - wheelers in our country is expected to touch the 50 - million mark by A . D . 2000 .
The menace of air pollution attributed to the automobile exhausts has now reached the peak level and if this trend continues , we may have to wear nasal filters on our noses in future .
Automobiles are a still greater source of pollution in other parts of the world .
They account for 60 per cent of the air pollution , with carbon monoxide levels in Mexico City exceeding those in Los Angeles on the west coast of USA .
Similarly Sydney in Australia , long believed to be the last outpost of a clean environment , is reported to be plagued with a higher percentage of automobile emissions than any city in the USA .
This contains paper , packing materials , polythene bags , used sachets , plastic bottles , metal containers , cookery wastes , putrid vegetables , glass pieces , etc .
Dust from Quarries Construction of dwelling houses and setting up of industries have increased manifold during the last two decades .
To cater to the demand for stones and cement to be used in these buildings , newer types of machineries are put into use .
Effects on Materials Air pollutants like sulphur dioxide , smoke , grit and dust cause damage to property and materials .
Sulphur dioxide is the most damaging of all gaseous pollutants .
In the presence of moisture it gets converted into sulphuric acid which is very corrosive , particularly for building structures , because it reacts easily with limestone .
It forms calcium sulphate , leading to a slow loss of limestone and unsightly blistering of the rain - washed areas .
Hydrogen sulphide is known to react with lead paint used in buildings , causing formation of lead sulphide which produces a brown to black discolouration in buildings .
Global Effects Unlike other types of pollution , air pollution impinges on the climate too .
Day by day the earth becomes more warmer . The globe is now 0.6C warmer than it was during the pre - industrial era and the rate may escalate further by Is the greenhouse effect so serious ?
Yes it is .
The pH is an index of hydrogen ion concentration of the liquid .
In this scale , a low pH means high concentration of the hydrogen ion and high acidity .
Pure water has a pH of 7 , and this is neutral pH .
Water with a pH less than 7 tends to be acidic while water of pH above 7 is alkaline .
Rain - water usually has a pH lower than 7 ( pH 5.7 , mild acid ) due to the dissolved carbon dioxide in it ; this amount of acidity is not corrosive .
The pH range of acid rain - water is between 2 - 5 .
This low pH means high acidity , and subsequently , high corrosivity .
Thus water with pH 4 is more corrosive ( 10 times ) than water with pH 5 .
Water of pH 3 is still more corrosive ( 100 times ) than water having a pH 5 .
If this is the case then one can imagine the corrosive nature of acid rain with a pH ranging between . 2 and 3 .
For instance , relations between West Germany and Sweden are sour because nearly 20 per cent of Sweden ' s lakes are affected by acid rain due to the emission of acidic gases from Germany ' s Ruhr industrial area .
In fact , Swedish school children launched a postcard campaign against West Germany in protest against such emissions .
Relations between England and its neighbour are no better either , with Scandinavia blaming England of being responsible for acid deposition in their country .
Dispute over acid rain has led to strained relations between the USA and Canada .
Nearly half of the sulphur deposits in Canada come from the USA and about 20 per cent of the deposits in north - east USA originate in Canada .
The direct relation of acid rain to human health has not yet been thoroughly established .
However , it is believed that inhalation of high levels of sulphur dioxide over extended periods may lead to respiratory diseases such as emphysema , asthma and bronchitis .
India is not seriously threatened by this scourge as we have coal reserves with low sulphur content , ranging from 0.5 - 0.7 per cent .
The main constituent of acid wastes is sulphuric acid .
In addition , nitric acid , hydrochloric acid and phosphoric acid are also present .
These acids cause damage to metals or concrete structures , pumps , etc . due to their corrosive action .
Moreover , hydrogen sulphide gas is produced when the acids come into contact with the sludge and the mud of the rivers .
Acidic pollutants also destroy micro - organisms inhibiting ( PREVIOUS ) ( NEXT ) the self - purification process of the rivers .
Fish and other aquatic animals are adversely affected with the sudden change in the pH .
Acids are reported to be lethal to fish and other forms of aquatic life .
Alkalis : Presence of alkalis alters the pH value in rivers resulting in the break off of the natural buffer system .
Like acids , alkalis too destroy bacterial and other micro - organisms so as to restrict the self - purification of the stream .
Fish and other aquatic life are also affected by the sudden rise in pH . Presence of strong alkalis can cause asphyxiation by coagulating the gill secretions in fish .
If he continued to experimenthe never ceased to experimentit was not because he had not found his form but because there is no end to this discovery .
In winter , as he put it , " lyrical fervour is apt to grow cold , and one gets the leisure to write drama . "
The breath of spring blows through every line of it , it throbs with the ecstasy of sensuous delight .
Indeed , the theme is the enchantment of spring and the power of its spell on the senses .
Spring is itself one of the characters in this play , which is one of Rabindranath ' s most beautiful plays .
almost flawless as a work of art , and in a class by itself .
Written in blank verse , it was his last great experiment in that form .
The simple and bald episode , as recorded in the Mahabharata , was transformed by Rabindranath into a drama tense and vibrant with lyrical rapture and full of deep psychological insight .
Princess Chitra who had been brought up as a boy and trained in the rough art of the battle - field was plain and rugged to look at and knew " no feminine wiles for winning hearts . "
The cattle drank water from the nearby stream and developed diarrhoea and within a few days suffered paralytic strokes , followed by death .
It was found that the stream was polluted with lead compounds which led to lead poisoning .
The hexavalent form is reported to be toxic for human beings and aquatic life .
Copper sulphate and copper compounds are being used extensively in treatment of reservoir water to control the growth of algae and diatoms .
Copper is extremely poisonous and its effects need no explanation .
The metals described above are toxic to fish and other aquatic life .
Heavy metal ions precipitate the mucous secretions of their gills .
These precipitates occupy the interlamellar space obstructing the movement of gill filaments and respiration .
Thousands of acres of fertile land have acquired salinity and become unfit for agriculture .
The ground - water table over many square kilometres has been so seriously affected that water from the wells in these areas has turned bitter .
It is an irony that these waters have become unsuitable even for tanning , and hence are transported in lorries from far - off places by the tanners .
The problem of ground - water pollution is so serious in Andhra Pradesh that water from the open wells and bore wells in the Hussainsagar area ( Hyderabad ) , especially at Domalguda , Ashok Nagar and Himayat Nagar emanate a pungent odour .
The percentage of dissolved solids is also high , rendering the water unfit for drinking .
The reason for such deterioration in quality is attributed to the industrial discharges in these areas .
Lung and skin diseases are prevalent among the villagers , and all due to polluted ground - water .
A different type of ground - water pollutionintrusion of sea - waterdue to over - pumping is a common phenomenon in coastal areas of our country .
Excess withdrawal of ground - water through heavy duty pumps has resulted in the flooding of sea - water through the cavities .
For instance , in our country distilleries are engaged in setting up bio - gas plants which are fed by their effluents .
This results in a substantial reduction in fuel costs and decrease in the strength of the effluent .
Conversion of Sludge into Useful Products : The sludge obtained on treatment of effluents is also a problem .
The sludge from pulp and paper industry may be used for the manufacture of boards used in packing or in preparation of artificial wooden panels .
The sludge from the electroplating industry may be used in the formulation of water - proofing compounds .
Reclamation and Reuse of Waste Water : At present recovery of chemicals and metals is practised in most industries .
These can be utilised either for irrigation or as fertilisers after proper treatment , without affecting land and / or ground - water .
Wastes from nuclear power plants do not give off offensive odour nor do they release any obnoxious gases .
The cause of the problem is that nuclear waste becomes harmless only after millions of years .
The plutonium produced during power generation ( 200 kg per year per reactor ) is sufficient to cause cancer in every human being .
Abnormal births , mutations , sterility , severe skin burns and lowering of body resistance against disease are other serious effects .
Constant exposure to radiation causes genetic defects and can affect the generations to come .
Radio - tracers are extensively used in the fields of medicine , industry , agriculture and biology to determine the course of chemical and biochemical reactions .
Substances administered to patients and used in radiation therapy are now proving important sources of nuclear harm .
It can cause mental anguish too . .
Our community functions and ceremonies like marriages , festivals , etc . are noisy events .
Dr Kameswaran describes life for man in the following words : " He wakes up to noise from transistors and TV , works in a noisy industry , goes to his workplace through noisy streets lined with loudspeakers and returns to a noisy home .
If he goes to the cinema for relaxation , there too the noise levels are too high . "
Effects of Noise Pollution A survey was conducted in various towns and cities of India to check the sound levels .
It revealed that noise during daytime in Delhi , Bombay , Calcutta and Madras ranges between 60 - 90 dB ( decibels ) .
Acute damage occurs to the eardrum when exposed to very loud and sudden noises .
A more serious consequence of noise pollution is the chronic damage to the hair cells in the - inner ear .
Prolonged exposure to noise of certain frequency pattern leads to temporary or permanent hearing loss .
Acoustic zones should be created to prevent propagation of noise through air or solids .
Trees may be planted in and around the factory to attenuate noise .
The sides of the roads or highways could be lined with trees , which act as a buffer and reduce the noise level .
Noise at community level can be curbed by imposing a ban on blaring loudspeakers and by reducing their pitch .
This is particularly necessary near hospitals and schools .
Sound can be beautiful , like that of music , singing and laughter , so long it is within our own hearing range and not forcibly imposed upon our neighbours too .
It has been proved that constant loud noise can impair hearing ability and cause problems connected with nervous disorders .
In October 1912 , Rabindranath sailed for the United States , accompanied by his son and daughter - in - law .
The son who had earlier graduated from the University of Illinois persuaded the father ' to spend some quiet months at Urbana where Tagore wrote his first original serious prose in English , later delivered as Lectures at the Harvard University and published as Sadhana .
In these lectures he interpreted , in his own fashion , " the ancient spirit of India , " as revealed in the utterance and example of her sages .
The Times Literary Supplement wrote : " And in reading these poems one feels , not that they are the curiosities of an alien mind , but that they are prophetic of the poetry that might be written in England if our poets could attain to the same harmony of emotion and idea .
Some perhaps will refuse to fall under the spell of this Indian poet because this philosophy is not theirs .
If it seems to us fantastic and alien , before we despise it we should ask ourselves the question : What is our philosophy ?
A recent survey indicates that much of the Himalayas , the Western Ghats , and the Shivalik ranges are now devoid of forest cover .
A satellite imagery reveals that the forest cover is being lost at the rate of 130 million sq m a year .
A report indicates that within a period of 10 years , from 1972 to 1982 , the forest cover in Punjab has declined from 1,200 sq km to 490 sq km .
The rate of depletion in Haryana is no less .
Most mountains in the Himalayas have been denuded and womenfolk have to walk daily for several kilometres to collect fuel .
People feel that forests are their open treasure - houses for them to use as they feel like .
They cut trees to collect firewood , to graze its cattle and to take whatever they fancy from the forest . Our firewood requirement per annum is about 330 million m .
Secondly , the greed of our forest contractors is compounding the problem .
At the international conference on human environment at Stockholm in 1972 , the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said , " Development is one of the primary means of improving the environment for the living or providing food , water , sanitation and shelter , of making the deserts green and the mountains habitable . "
While pollution cannot be curbed completely , the levels of pollution can be minimised by adopting remedies that are simple and low cost .
For example , deforestation must be followed by afforestation .
One tree should be planted for each tree axed .
The Visakhapatnam steel plant in Andhra Pradesh has planted over two million trees in its complex .
They have also coined a slogan : ' A tree for each tonne of liquid steel produced . '
The Hindustan Zinc Ltd . , the leading manufacturers of zinc and lead , say , " We do n ' t just enjoy the environment ; we protect it too , " and to prove it they have planted thousands of trees in their premises and surrounding villages .
The Indian Oil Corporation Ltd . have developed green belts around their refinery units and during the year 1991 , they planted more than a lakh trees .
Reuse of waste water plays a crucial role in abating pollution .
We are very restless in thought , but we have none that poets can express . "
Indeed , critics were not wanting who refused " to fall under the spell of this Indian poet . "
The reaction among Tagore ' s own countrymen was no less mixed .
Basanta Kumar Roy , who was then living in the United States and who later published Tagore ' s biography in that country , tells us that several young Bengalis in the United States were furious when they read the following statement by an English missionary published in an English review : " For many centuries no such poet and musician has appeared in India . "
One of them " shouted in true American fashion , Dn it . "
Others cited many other Bengali poets , among them Nabin Sen and D . L . Roy , as much greater than Tagore .
" His love lyrics , " they went on to say , " are poor imitations of the poems of our Vaishnava poets of old , and his philosophy is the philosophy of the Upanishads .
At any rate Tagore ' s name was now sufficiently bandied about in the English papers for his reputation to have crossed the Atlantic .
Perhaps the first journal in the West to publish his poems .
This was followed by an invitation from the Chicago Universityfor a lecture .
It was while Tagore was still in Urbana that Basanta Kumar Roy came to visit him to persuade him to translate more of his work into English , for he felt certain that when his writings became known , " You will sooner or later win the Nobel Prize for Poetry .
Naively Tagore inquired , " Are the Asiatics eligible for the Prize ? "
" The awarding of the Nobel Prize for Literature , " wrote an American paper , " to a Hindu has occasioned much chagrin and no little surprise among writers of the Caucasian race .
They cannot understand why this distinction was bestowed upon one who is not white . "
The Globe of Toronto , Canada , wrote : " It is the first time that the Nobel Prize has gone to any one who is not what we call ' white ' .
The Times , Los Angeles , complained that young modern writers in Europe and America had been discouraged by the award of the Prize " to a Hindu poet whose name few people can pronounce , with whose work fewer in America are familiar , and whose claim for that high distinction still fewer will recognise . "
In January 1913 Rabindranath came to Chicago where he lectured on the " Ideals of the Ancient Civilisation of India " and on " The Problem of Evil " .
After visiting New York Tagore returned to London in April 1913 where also he delivered a course of lectures at the Caxton Hall .
When he had arrived in London less than a year earlier , he was an unknown stranger .
Now he had become a sensation and a curiosity .
None of these books can be considered particularly pious or religious or philosophical and might have been expected to give the foreign reader a better perspective to his work .
Tagore was the first to impress vividly on the intellectual consciousness of the West the factnow amply demonstrated that the " mind " of Asia was lying and would have to be reckoned with as a vital entity and not merely as an interesting specimen in a museum .
Here , surely , is the person we have been longing for one sent before the chariot of the Lord to make His path straight And when we remember that this poet ' s every word is eagerly caught up by waiting millions , may we not venture to assert that the new , the Christian India , is already at the door ? "
It needed the courage and clarity of mind of a Dean Inge to remind his co - religionists that " Tagore is not a Christian ; but his attitude reminds us that there was a time when Christianity was an Asiatic creedit was the time of the original Gospel .
Then there were , as always , the usual clever people who believe they can see through everything .
Some of them saw in the award the ingenious British hand trying to boost the glory of the Empire ; others fancied that the Swedish literary circles , being pro - German , had deliberately tried to embarrass the British ruling classes .
There is no end to human cleverness .
The first formal proposal was made by the English poet , Sturge Moorej in a letter brief and bald enough to be worth quoting .
Shelley , in spite of his vague idealism , roused our minds because of his fanatic impetuosity which is born of a faith in life .
We cannot but miss a great deal of the purely artistic element of your literature but whatever is broadly human and deeply true can be safely shipped for distant times and remote countries .
We look for your literature to bring , us the thundering life flood of the west , even though it carries with it all the debris of the passing moments . "
Though Choudhury ( whose pen - name was Birbal , after the witty courtier of Emperor Akbar ) was a brilliant writer himself , the main burden of maintaining the prestige and popularity of the journal fell upon Tagore ' s shoulders .
As though he needed this incentive , he responded to the pressure with an abundance of literary output as remarkable for its quality as for its varietypoems , short stories , essays and novels .
The stories he wrote at this period do not have the freshness and charm which mark the stories he wrote in the nineties when he lived in his boat on the Padma and watched the changing landscape of nature and life on its banks with gentle and detached affection and ironic sympathy .
The next morning she laid aside her man ' s garment and decked in feminine finery sought Arjuna out in the forest and tried to woo him .
But Arjuna repulsed her advances and said that he was under an oath of celibacy and could not touch a woman .
Humiliated and wounded in the core of her being , Chitra broke her bow into two and invoked by her penance Madana , the god of love .
Madana appeared before her with his boon companion , Vasanta , god of spring and eternal youth , The Princess begged , " For a single day make me superbly beautiful , as beautiful as was the sudden awakening of love in my heart .
Give me but one day of perfect beauty , and I will answer for the days that follow . "
While she was washing her limbs and playing with water on the edge of a forest pool , Arjuna saw her and was swept off his feet .
Forgetting his vow of celibacy he wooed her .
For some months the lovers lived in the bliss of love ' s abandon .
Their idealism was not with out a hard core of realism and a sense of humour .
The memory of the experiment survives in the observance of 10 March every year as Gandhi Day ( Gandhi Punyaha ) when all the paid servants are given a holiday and the teachers and pupils do all the cooking themselves and give an annual spring - cleaning to the asrama .
A typical example of recurrent symbolism in Indian tradition .
Gandhi ' s reformist zeal did not spare the poet ' s personal diet either .
Watching him eat luchis one evening at dinner , Gandhi remarked that white - flour pancake fried in ghee which the poet was eating with obvious relish was poison .
Rabindranath smiled and said softly , " It must be a very slow poison , for I ' ve been eating it for about half a century now . "
Gandhi and Tagore the saint who strove to make politics holy and the poet who made holiness seem beautiful .
Gandhi ' s practice was always in advance of his ideology ; Tagore had wings to his thoughts and feet to his practice .
However firm and unfaltering the feet , they could not keep pace with the wings .
Gandhi , the stern ascetic , was more humane than the humanist ; a kill - joy in theory he brought comfort to millions of human hearts .
Jagmohan ' s God - denying humanism is contrasted in the first chapter with his brother ' s God - believing meanness and cupidity .
Sachish , revolted by his father ' s sickening orthodoxy , is a follower of his uncle ' s way of life .
He comes across a young girl , an orphan , who had been seduced by his own elder brother and thrown on the streets .
He takes the girl , now pregnant , to his uncle ' s house who gives her shelter and treats her as his daughter .
To safeguard her future Sachish offers to marry her .
But the girl , though she is grateful to her benefactors , is really in love with her seducer and prefers to commit suicide to the shame of marrying anyone else .
This incident comes as a shock to Sachrsh ' s cultivated belief in human rationalism .
Soon after , the city of Calcutta is scourged by plague and as there were not enough hospitals in the city , the humanitarian uncle turns his own house into a hospital for the poor , himself nursing the victims .
He catches the dread disease and dies .
" He deserved it , " comments his orthodox brother .
He is happy in his " escape " until a young and lively widow , an unwilling and rebellious disciple of the Guru , distracts his attention .
This girl , Damini , like Binodini of the earlier ChokherBali , is one of Tagore ' s few characters so full - blooded and real that no reader having known them ever forget them .
Damini loves Sachish but cares little for the Guru the facade of whose piety does not deceive her .
Sachish who believes that human love is a snare tries to avoid her but cannot help being conscious of her .
Once when the party has camped for the night in a cave , Sachish cannot sleep , haunted by a vague dread of some primeval beast hidden in the cave about to creep over him with its clammy paws .
Just then he feels a touch on his feet .
Unable to escape from thoughts of Damini , Sachish finally begs her to release him from her spell by voluntarily renouncing her desire for him .
The atmosphere of the novel is tense , reflecting the tensions of the period it depicts .
It was a stormy period of national upsurge , of an upheaval of violent passions long submerged , of a clash of ideals and interests .
The sombre narrative scintillates with brilliant sparks of thought as the flints of opposing arguments strike against one another .
It is a clash all along , of the old with the new , of real politik with idealism , of the means with - the end , of love claimed as of right and love given of free will , of home - bred virtue with the wild wind from the outside .
As one reads it one begins to understand , better than any expositions can demonstrate , how akin Tagore was to Gandhi in spirit , whatever the seeming difference in their ways .
The plot , like all Tagore ' s plots , is very simplethe usual , age - old triangle , two men and a woman .
Nevertheless , the character , as it emerges in the novel , is more shadowy than real .
His friend and protege , Saridip , the patriotic firebrand , splendid wind - bag and shameless seducer , on the other hand , is far more real and convincing except that he speaks a language which only a Tagore could put in his mouth .
Nikhil knows what is going on betiweeia his wife and his friend and could easily put a stop to it , but he values love only when given out of free will and in open competition with the outside world and not as an obligation or under duress .
What happens between the three , let the reader find out for himself , for the book is available in English translationThe Home and the World .
A significant title in more senses than the one employed for the novel .
Tagore himself was tossing between his love of his home and the hire of the world .
He was restless once again .
" I have the call of the open road , though most of the roads are closed , " he wrote to Andrews in June 1915 .
" I am in a nomadic mood , but it is becoming painful to me for want of freedom .
They are by no means literature of any high . quality , though many of them are interesting in themselves .
Some of them are quoted below as specimens : " I cannot choose the best .
The best chooses me . "
" Every child comes with the message that God is not yet discouraged of man . "
" He who is busy doing good finds no time to be good . "
One was prophetic of Japan ' s future : " Your idol is shat - Icrrcl in the dust to prove that God ' s dust is greater than your idol . "
Though the Japanese welcomed Tagore with enthusiasm the poet - seer from the land of the Buddhathe enthusiasm cooled off as soon as he warned them in his lectures against imitating , not the humane valucsof the western civilisation but its lust for power and its blind worship of collective egoism in the name of the Nation .
" Europe is supremely good in her beneficence where her face is turned to all humanity ; and Europe is supremely evil in her maleficent aspect where her face is turned upon her own interest , using all her power of greatness for ends which are against the infinite and the eternal in Man . "
He admired the Japanese for being modern but reminded them that " True modernism is freedom of mind , not slavery of taste .
He hated the sight of excited crowds gloating over bonfires of foreign - made cloth , he pitied the students being made to give up schools and colleges to become pawns in the hands of politicians .
Without directly referring to the Mahatma or criticising his leadership , Tagore gave eloquent expression to his faith in the necessity of intellectual and moral cooperation between India and the west in a public lecture in Calcutta entitled SiksharMilan ( Meeting of Cultures ) .
So isolated was he even among his own people in Bengal that his speech provoked a rejoinder from the popular Bengali novelist , Sarat Chandra Chatterji , in an article entitled Sikshar Virodh ( Conflict of Cultures ) .
Soon after , the Mahatma visited Calcutta and on 6 September 1921 the two had a long conference behind closed doors in the poet ' s house at Jorasanko , the only other person present at the interview being Andrews , No authorised report exists of what transpired , but it was understood that Gandhi had come to persuade Tagore to give open and active support to his political programme .
While Gandhi and Tagore were in conference , a large crowd had gathered outside the house and eager to show its sympathy with what the Mahatma stood for and to teach the world - obsessed poet a lesson , had collected large bundles of foreign cloth from nearby shops and set up a bonfire right in the midst of the open courtyard in Tagore ' s house .
Leonard Elmhirst has related that Tagore himself some time later gave him a gist of his conversation with the Mahatma on that memorable day .
They have stolen cloth from the shops in the Chitpore Road , they ' ve lit that bonfire in my courtyard and are now howling round it like a lot of demented dervishes .
" Non - cooperation clashed with his way of thinking , for his mentality , his rich intelligence , had been nourished on all cultures of the world . "
What Tagore feared was not Gandhi ' s spirit of exclusionhe knew that the Mahatma was above it but that of his followers who would not scruple to inflame prejudice or passion to work up a fever of nationalism .
What sacrifice are the students called upon to make ?
Not sacrifice for more complete education but for no education .
More than a decade earlier when he himself was a leader of the Swadeshi movement in Bengal , a group of young students had come and told him that they were prepared to give up their studies if he asked them to do so .
When he declined to do so , they went away in anger , doubting his patriotism .
And the only criticism one can make of them is that they plane too high .
Here I feel every day what a terrible nightmare it is for the human soul to bear this burden of the monster of Arithmetic .
It incessantly drivers its victims and yet leads them nowhere .
In the Diary which he began keeping during his voyage to South America two years later , he has described how the suffocation he had suffered in America brought about in its reaction the mood in which these poems were born .
The sight of monstrous accumulation of wealth , luxury and power and man ' s blind and smug belief that this accumulation will keep on piling and will last forever had invoked before his mind the image of Siva Bholanath , the god of supreme detachment and unconcern , whose divine dance makes and unmakes the universe , mocking at man ' s vanity .
" I sleep and awake , sleep again and wake .
When you put me to sleep , you lose me , mother , and yet you do not lose meexcept as the night loses the sun and the day loses the stars . . . "
" Were you not my mother , but some one else ' s , d ' you think I would n ' t know you , mother ?
Would n ' t I still hide in your lap ?
What fun it would be to have two homes , one for the day and one at night !
As the evening came I would creep up stealthily behind you , put my hands over your eyes and ask , ' Who am I ? ' And you would say , ' Surely some one I know , and yet I know not who . . . "
Where I came from , that ' s where I want to go .
But where it is , I keep on guessing .
Then it seems to me that it must be everywhere .
" Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , they comeso soon , they must have airplanes at home .
But why does Sunday come so late , mother ?
It seems to lag behind all others .
Does he live farthest of all , as far away as the sky is , and is he the child of poor parents as you were , mother ? "
The poet said as much in a letter to his niece Indira : " I wrote these poems to give respite to my mind from ' its obsession with adult responsibilities .
I have tried to express in them what had of late persistently recurred to my mind , namely , that the meaning of my life was summed up in its foreword which said that I was born as a child in the playground of this world .
We forget that thereby we malign the Creator of the universe , Who functions without toil , Who is supreme bliss because He is free of all obligations . "
But the respite was brief and intermittent Santiniketan clamoured for his attention .
Pearson returned to the asrama on 26 September , after an absence of five years .
With him came Leonard Elmhirst , the young Englishman whom Tagore had met in New York .
He had accepted Tagore ' s invitation to help in organising a rural community welfare centre at Sriniketan and had brought with him adequate funds for the purpose made possible by the generosity of Dorothy Straight Soon after , " the French savant Sylvain Levi arrived as Visiting Professor to Visva - Bharati and thus was founded the first department of Tibetan and Chinese Studies in any Indian University .
How I wish I could find my reed again and be contemptuously ignored by the busy and the wise as a hopeless ne ' er - do - well ! "
Would Tagore have been a greater poet if the Nobel Prize and the consequent blaze of fame and publicity had not invaded the obscurity in which his genius had so far matured ?
Would his spiritual insight have plumbed deeper depths if he had continued to churn the ocean of self instead of sailing over the oceans in missionary zeal to help men understand one another better ?
Who can say what might have been , if this or that had or had not happened ?
These are vain guesses : " With an ' if ' you might put Paris in a bottle , " is a wise French saying . ,
What is remarkable is that despite the many temptations , distractions , and occasional aberrations , he never strayed too far or for long from his true vocation , which was that of the poet and singer , a lover of nature and of men , a devotee who saw the divine in man and hailed the human in the divine .
Indeed , one might even say that the western interludes and periodic spells of missionary fervour were distractions that served as healthy diversions enriching his spirit and enlarging his mental horizons .
Whether because of it or in spite of it , the fact is that Tagore never ceased to be creative , in the best sense of the word , till the last day of his conscious life and continued to explore new fields and to reach heights unsealed before in Bengali language and literature .
Even during his comparatively sterile periods he wrote enough and of such quality as to make many another writer famous .
It is true that at times the inspiration seemed to wane , the vitality to flag , and he drew less from life than from habit .
In August and September a new musical sequence Varshamangal ( Rains Festival ) and a new version of his earlier drama Saradotsav ( Autumn Festival ) were presented on the Calcutta stage .
These compositions which are an enchanting amalgam of poetry , drama , music and dance were written for community celebration of the seasons of the year and breathe of the open air and the simple joy of living .
They were not built on any pattern , the folk and classical traditions intermingle in them as freely as do philosophy and frivolity , religious mysticism and a running commentary on contemporary affairs .
The Mahatma was in jail , and Tagore in his address to the students and inmates of the asrama dwelt at length on " the true meaning of sacrifice which Gandhiji represents . "
His simple and homely address is instinct with deep respect for the Mahatma ' s personality .
Returning to Santiniketan in April , he left soon after for Shillong to spend the summer in that lovely hill station of Assam .
He had only to stay quiet to be creative , and so in Shillong he commenced writing a remarkable play , which he named Rakta Karabi , later translated and published in English as Red Oleanders .
This play , like the earlier one , Muktadhara , . shows Tagore ' s increasing concern with the basic problems of modern civilisation .
The ageing ' poet was reliving in imagination his romantic youth .
His younger contemporaries , charmed by his latest Novel , begged him to make an anthology of his love poems and add a few new ones .
The suggestion was enough to stimulate a mind that needed no more than a prod .
As he himself put it lightly , he was like an automobile engine which kept on running , once the self - starter was released .
So instead of compiling a selection he wrote a completely new volume of verses , mostly love poems , which he named Mahua , after the strong scerited Indian flower of spring which yields a native heady wine .
The title was appropriate , for these poems , some of them very tender and exquisite , were not born of the anguish of a living experience but were induced by an artificial stimulus , as but intoxication .
Not quite artificial , for the poet was always in love with love , an impersonal love .
It was during the rainy season of this year , 1928 , that Tagore introduced two seasonal festivals , Vriksharopana ( Tree - planting ) and Hala - karshana ( Ploughing ) at Santiniketan and Sriniketan respectively .
These picturesque festivals with their simple and artistic ceremonials accompanied by music , dancing and Vedic chanting , invoking nature ' s fertility and symbolising its ever - recurring youth , are still celebrated annually and attract crowds of visitors from the neighbouring countryside , and from Calcutta .
On I March 1929 Tagore sailed for Canada at the invitation of the National Council of Education of that country .
On arrival in Los Angeles his passport was unfortunately lost and he felt irritated by the formalities to which he was subjected by the Immigration Officers some of which he considered too humiliating .
He therefore cancelled his engagements in the States and sailed for Japan .
This was not the first occasion when an accident intervened to mar his appreciation of the United States .
On a previous visit too he had been rubbed the wrong way .
It was unfortunate indeed that his high expectations received repeated rebuffs in a country known for the exuberance of its hospitality and friendliness .
He spent nearly a month in Japan .
He loved this country and its brave and disciplined people and was filled with unhappiness as he watched their minds being steadily warped by a deliberately engineered hysteria of imperial ambition .
With his usual courage he warned them in a public address against " the ghosts of ideals which no longer have a living reality , " which merely serve to alienate nations from one another .

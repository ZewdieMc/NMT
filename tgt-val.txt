" How like our Prophet ! " whispered the audience as they saw the Indian poet .
That the Passion Play left a deep impression oh his mind can be guessed from the theme of his poem , The Child , which he wrote soon after during his stay in Germany , the only poem he ever wrote directly in English .
Fortunately , he kept a record of his impressions in a series of letters he wrote home , which were later published as Rashiar Chithi ( letters ' from Russia ) .
These letters testify to one of the most significant qualities of the ageing poet , namely , that as he grew older in years , he seemed to become younger in spirit .
A reception was also organised for him at the Carnegie Hall where he spoke on Education , Ruth St . DDenis who admired him gave dance - recitals to raise funds for his school , but as her own country had been recently hard hit by an economic crisis , the poet handed over the proceeds for the benefit of the unemployed in New York .
Inscribing the book to Tagore , Will Durant had written , " You alone are sufficient reason why India should be free . "
In January 1931 Tagore returned to India via London where he had a long talk with Bernard Shaw at a luncheon which the Spectator gave for him in Hyde Park Hotel .
It had been a long and tiring tour but rich and fruitful in experience .
He had seen the western world in its different phases and had left behind a trail of memory which , though it soon faded as all memory must , was not altogether lost .
He did not know then that this was his last visit to the west , that his sun in the western sky had set .
ONE might ask why he who welcomed , despite his repugnance to violence , the stormy upheaval in Russia did not show the same enthusiasm for the non - violent mass movement which the Ma - hatma was leading nearer home .
Soon after his return to India in November 1890 the poems of Manasi were published .
Their wide range and sweep of imagination , their maturity of thought , their lyrical beauty and strengthlike a rider at ease on a spirited horse , in firm control of his seat , using no whip , the horse obeying the slightest hint of his hand or heelconvinced even his detractors that here indeed was a poet .
The poems cover five broad categories which were always to remain his major themes , though later the scope was to widen : love poems , poems of nature , poems dealing with social and national problems , religious and mystical poems and poems which use natural or legendary phenomena or historical anecdotes to embody the author ' s metaphysics or philosophy .
The human and the divine , love of nature and of man , intuition and thought so mingle and interpenetrate in his consciousness that in his poetry , as in actual life , it is difficult to separate one from the other .
Recalling the legendary times when in the forest groves of Brindaban on the bank of the Jumna , Radha pined for Krishna and left her home in the stormy night to seek her love , he finds that Brindaban survives in the human heart , for even now on a stormy night of rain or a hushed evening of autumn , full - mooned , destruction , the little lamp of love and faith continues to burn in the human heart , which no storm has yet succeeded in blotting out for ever .
He is still haunted by his experience of the Borderland , though the enchantment of life was beginning to regain its hold on him .
A few lines are quoted below in the poet ' s own English rendering ; My birthday !
From Kalimpong he went to Mungpoo , a nearby hillside in Darjeeling district , to be the guest for a few days of a young poetess , an ardent admirer and devotee whose husband was the Director or me Government Cinchona plantation ( from which quinine is extracted ) .
There he wrote , besides some poems , a treatise on Bengali language , later published as Bangla Bhasha Parichaya ( An Introduction to Bengali Language ) .
Study of Bengali language , its structure and sound system , its folk reserves and literary usages were an old hobby of his and his explorations in this field bear ample evidence of his remarkable critical insights .
Something of the dashing adventurism of his romantic grandfather as well as the severe and practical idealism of his father had survived in him , although assuming vastly different colours .
These and many other poems of varying quality and depicting a variety of moods and feelings were published at the end of the year in a volume named appropriately , Rogasajyay ( On the Sickbed , 1940 ) .
This was followed by another published in early 1941 , Arogya ( Convalescence ) .
He loved the sun , and most of the poems in this volume and in the previous one were dictated in the early hours of the morning or the day .
In the evening the fever would return and he felt too weak and worn - out for any exertion .
The very first poem of the new volume is a reaffirmation of his old faith .
They too will pass and " leave not a sign behind . "
In their wishful thinking , the best homage they can pay Tagore is to make him out to be a poet of the proletariat .
He was committed only to his love of life and his reverence for its common joys and sorrows , and this poem is in fact only a " rnight yhymn of life , " to borrow the poem ' s words .
He had loved and felt for the common man all his life , long before it became a fashion to do so .
Nearly half a century earlier when he was living in the country and looking after the family estates his letters bear testimony to his very deep feeling and concern for the lowly folk , the peasant and the toiler .
This concern was humane , a normal expression of a healthy moral sensibility , and not derived from any ideology .
Nor is there anything particularly original or revolutionary in the statement that while empires fall , the common man continues to maintain life on earth .
It is the way it is said that makes the poem so memorable .
Some poems were written on his last birthday at Mungpoo , to which a reference was made earlier .
One of the finest among them was dictated at Santiniketan on 21 January 1941 .
knowable only when mind communes with mind . Not everywhere have I had this communion , the fences raised round my life ' s path have barred my entry to many a door .
Having confessed to his limitation , he hails the poet of the future who will be close to the soil , who will share the tiller ' s life and be his comrade , who will be a poet of dumb , obscure men , give voice to their hidden sorrow , and bring joy and song to this dry and desolate land .
Or did he anticipate it and hence the warning ?
In any case , though the admission of his limitations was candid and showed how high and noble was his conception of a poet ' s role , he need not have been unduly apologetic about his own .
Those who sing passionately of the dispossessed seem to have little sympathy for anything else .
This is testified by a Pallava inscription of the seventh centrury AD in one of the early cave - temples at Mahabalipuram .
Then again , Buddhist tantric rituals percolated into the Hindu modes of worship .
With such a background the growth of temples and organized temple worship became truly phenomenal .
The southern temples with their characteristic tiered vimana shrines , major and minor , their axial and peripheral mandapa adjuncts , which are flat - roofed halls , and the towering gopura entrances form a distinct class by themselves as against the northern prasada temples with their curvilinear superstructures , the crowning amalaka and mandapas with rising tiered roofs .
The whole is enclosed by a brick - wall with entrance on the front side ( east or west ) on the gopura pattern , with simpler additional entrances on the south and north sides .
The maha - mandapa in some cases is often extended laterally by one or more bays and , in some instances , there were pillared cloisters ( malikai or malika ) inside the enclosure walls surrounding the court round the three sides of the maha - mandapa .
The temple complexes have a single main shrine or sometimes more than one main shrine .
The single shrines are oblong , square or apsidal in plan .
While the mandapas had flat roofs , the shrine superstructures , particularly of the apsidal ones , were gaja - prishtha , i . e . with forms resembling the hind - quarters of an elephant .
Its longer axis north - south was preceded by a closed maha - mandapa with six rows of five pillars each .
Beyond the Bombay - Poona region , where the soft trap - rock formations were exploited for excavation of chaityas and viharas , further north and north - west , the laterite hills as in Junagad , afforded the venue for such excavations ; laterite when freshly exposed being equally soft and tractable .
Futher south , beyond Konkan , in the Kerala area , west of the ghats , again abounding in laterite , it was excavated into , though as cave - tombs of megalithic association in corresponding times .
The porch framing the entrance shows similar imitation of timberwork in stone , including the torana arch above the lintel .
The Buddhist cave - temple in Kondivte is of similar design where the circular shrine or garbha - griha is occupied by a solid stupa leaving only a narrow circumambulatory passage or pmdakshina all round within the shrine and occupying the end of a rectangular hall or mandapa , with a flat roof as the shrine itself .
The Tulaja cave in Junnar is also an excavation after the model of a circular chaitya .
The main roofing dome rests on a ring of twelve plain octagonal pillars , instead of on a circular wallas in the other examplesenclosing a central stupa , both surrounded by a circular aisle , or pradakshina , which is half - domed .
The other chaityas are mainly apsidal in plan , consisting of a long rectangular hall like a nave , terminating at the farther end into an apse with often two narrower aisles on either side , each separated from the nave by a row of pillars and extended round the apse as a circumambulatory passage round a stupa , also hewn out of rock and occupying the centre of the apse .
The doorway in front is a huge threshold with an arched window on top .
In front of the facade of the hall , a transverse verandah with frontal pillars is often cut .
The result was that these two parallel traditions continued in the south in the respective regions till the advent of the Vijayanagar empire in the second half of the fourteenth century , which soon embraced in its ambit both these regions and in fact soon extended practically over the whole of south India .
The soft stone tradition of the northern region almost came to an end and the use of hard stone for temple construction became almost universal , though the regional styles and distinguishing characters that had developed up to that time in either region were generally maintained .
The three centuries covering the rock - cut phase in the Brahmanical and Jain temple architecture coincided also with the great revivalist movements of the Hindus and the continuing hold of the Jain sects on some sections of the people .
With the commencement of the seventh century , and in the wake of the revivalist movements of the Hindus , great changes were wrought and the bhakti cult developed .
In the Tamil land the Saiva and Vaishnava hymnist saints , the Nayanmars and the Alvars , became wedded to the Vedic traditions and traversed the whole area visiting shrines , singing hundreds of devotional hymns in Tamil and rousing the people .
This also resulted in the reformation of the extremist Saiva creeds of the Kalamukhas , Pasupatas , Mahesvaras , Saktas and the like ; it curbed the strong hold that Jainism had on the people and almost led to the decline of Buddhism .
The Kannada area continued to be the centre of south Indian Jainism from where the various guchchhas branched out into the Tamil and Telugu areas .
The Govardhana - Krishna scene depicts Krishna as holding up the hill to afford shelter to the displaced gopas and gopis with their children , cattle and other belongings , when they had to flee their homes as result of a great deluge of rain and stone brought down by the irate . Indra .
The depiction is quite powerful and realistic .
A unique south Indian note is struck by the introduction of Krishna ' s favourite gopi , Nappinnai , huddling near him in the group and distinguished from the rest of the women in the scene by her dress , stance and attendant lady .
The Krishna - Nappinnai theme is special to the earlier and contemporary Tamil literature and tradition .
They continued the activity for over three centuries till they , like the Pallavas , were overthrown by the rising Cholas of Thanjavur .
These are found at Tiruvellarai , Narttamalai , Kunnandarkovil , Puvalaikkudi and other places , all in the Puduk - kottai and Tiruchirapalli districts .
Their cave - temples too are a type of mandapas with simples shrine - cells and are much akin to the Pandya cave - temple in the same area .
The Atiyaman , or Adigaiman chiefs , ruling in the Kongu area of Salem and Coimbatore districts , bordering on the Tiruchirapalli district , have excavated two fine cave - temples in Namakkal .
They are dedicated to Vishnu and are noted for their fine sculptured panels .
These cave - temples , numbering about sixty in all , are like the Pallava examples , excavated into the hard , local rocks and are essentially similar to the Mahendra - style excavations in plan and design .
They have massive pillars on the facades , essentially square in section at the base and top , with an octagonal middle section , carrying heavy potikas or corbels , usually with a straight bevel , resulting in an angular profile .
There are , however , some examples with pillars of other types and corbels with a curved profile and taranga moulding .
The cave - temples , all , lack a well - defined kapota in the architrave over their mandapa facades , as is also the case in the Mahendra - style cave - temples .
Some of the excavations are merely shrine - cells scooped directly into rock face , without a rock - cut mandapa in front .
Such cave - temples are numerous in this region and very rare in Tondaimandalam .
The inscription mentions the cave - temple significantly as kal - tiru - k - koyil or ' the sacred stone temple ' , echoing the pioneering idea for this region as found in Pallava Mahendravarman ' s inscription at Mandagappattu in Tondaimandalam .
The rock - cut cave - temple at Pillaiyarpatti ( Ramanathapuram district ) with an inscription in an archaic script would also be one of the early Pandya cave - temples , as also Siva Cave - temple III at Kunnakkudi in the same district , which has another short inscription in the same script calling it Masilisvaram .
The Vishnu ( Narasimha ) cave - temple at Anaimalai ( Madurai district ) has a foundation inscription giving the Kali year 3871 ( AD 770 ) and referring to its excavation by a minister of Pandya Maran Sadaiyan , alias Parantaka .
The large cave - temple at present famous as the Subrahmanya temple at Tirup - parankunram near Madurai was excavated earlier and later re - modelled by another Pandya minnister and his wife in the Kali year 3874 ( AD 773 ) , according to their foundation inscriptions there .
The other two excavations on either side of the larger mandapa - type cave - temple and above the level of the Jyeshtha cave shrine should be of a somewhat later date .
One of these contains a bas - relief of Gajalakshmi , and the other a group comprising devi as Bhuvanesvari and her attendants .
The well - known rock - cut cave - temple at Sittannavasal in the Pudukkottai area ( Tiruchirapalli district ) , containing the celebrated early mural paintings in fresco , is an example of a Jain cave - temple of the eighth - ninth centuries .
This , according to a long verse inscription associated with it , was re - embellished by a certain IIan Gautaman alias Madurai Asiriyan and a structural mukha - mandapa added in front , all in the reign of Avanipa - sekhara Sri Vallabha Pandya ( c . 815 - 862 ) .
The cave - shrine called Paliyilisvaram at Narttamalai , another Muttaraiyar excavation , dates a few years before the seventh year of Pallava Nripatunga in the late ninth century .
The same may be said of the Puvalaikkudi cave - shrine , which was excavated by a certain Amarunri Muttaraiyar .
The Vishnu cave - temple at Tirumayam , containing the reclining Vishnu group , is a natural cavern converted into a cave - temple with the addition of the facade pillars and other features by a queen of Perumbidugu Muttaraiyar and would date some time later than the Siva cave - temple of Satyagirisvara adjoining it .
A few others like the Mangadu cave - shrine and Malai - k - kolundisvaram cave - shrine in the same area , as also the cave - temples at Tiruvellarai , can be attributed to the Muttaraiyars .
The cave - temples at Trikkur , Irunilamkodu , Kottukkal and other places in the northern Kerala region are of the times of the rulers of the Chera country , while those in the southern parts , in the Quilon and Trivandrum districts of Kerala , and the Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu , or Venadu and Nanjilnadu as they are called , are perhaps mostly of the Pandya affiliation .
Because of lack of specific authentication and of the fact that Kerala was under more than one dynasty during the period from the middle of the seventh to the middle of the ninth centuries to which these cave - temples belong , it would be more rorrect to give them the regional nomenclature of Kerala than to call these all ' Chera ' .
The connected political history of the Cheras of the second period after the earlier Sangam epoch starts from the middle of the ninth century .
The two Vishnu cave - temples at Namakkal , one dedicated to Ranganathan or Anantasayin , and the other to Narasimha , are , according to their inscriptions , excavations by the Atiya king , Gunasila of the line of the Adigaimans known earlier from Tamil literature .
They belong to the first half of the eighth century and contain some fine sculptures .
The most characteristic feature of the style is the door - frame of the cella with elaborate over - door components .
The sakhas , or components of the over - door , range from three to many , the lintel - piece has a crest ornament the lalata bimba , and a superstructure , or uttamnga .
The basal part of the inner sakhas and the jamb carry panels with reliefs of the river goddesses , Ganga and Yamuna .
In the Chalukyan cave - temples of the southern zone , the Kannada area , dvarapala forms along with the river goddesses are depicted in the same panels .
This is in addition to the relatively larger dvarapalas in the niches flanking the outermost entrance of the front mandapa , or front porch of the cave - temple .
In Jogeshvari they flank the sanctum entrance , as also the outer mandapa entrance .
This would indicate an earlier stage , while the other Rashtrakuta caves show a tendency to revert to the scheme of less - than - life - size dvarapalas on either side of the sanctum entrance .
Besides the above , others like Caves 17 , 20 , 21 and 26 are of the sandhara type and have their shrine chambers at the rear of the pillared mandapa cut out on all sides , resulting in a circumambulatory passage .
The Dhumarlena , or Cave 29 , is of greatest interest since it is the largest and most imposing of the caves at Ellora .
Its sandhara and chaumukh , or chaturmukha shrine , is not only isolated but also contained within a group of mandapas arranged in a cruciform plan which is similar to that of the Elephanta and the Jogeshvari caves .
The four doorways of the shrine are flanked by large dvarapalas and other accompanying sculptures .
The long rectangular maha - mandapa or main hall that precedes the shrine and also partly surrounds it has a wide nave and aisles formed by a colonnade of five pillars on each side , of which the front encloses the main entrance .
Additionally flanking the main hall are two lateral entrances through two portals or pillared transepts .
The pillars are huge in size with kumbhas or cushion capitals , and the statutory inside is also ponderous and of large proportions .
The cave - temple can be dated to the middle of the seventh century in the Chalukyan period .
Cave 27 , or the Milkmaid ' s cave ( Gopilena ) , is an interesting example with triple shrines on the rear and side walls of the mandapa .
The upper floor has the navaranga hall with twelve outer pillars as in the Indra Sabha , but there is also a shrine at the rear .
From one corner of the mandapa and disposed at an angle is an additional unit similar in proportions and character to those of the groundfloor , but complete and richly carved .
In Elephanta , a tiny island off Bombay , the cave - temple is distinguished by the exceptional quality of its sculptures of which the great Mahesamurti is the most well known .
With the main east - west linear axis of the excavation parallel to the length of the rock , its plan consists of a large mandapa supported by twenty pillars on its periphery , eight ranged on each of the longer sides and two each on the front and the rear , between the corner pillars .
There are flights of steps in front of the shorter or front and rear sides , leading out into open courts on the respective sides , which are formed by cuttings that more or less isolate the section of the rock with its excavated cave - temple from the rest of the mass .
These two are designed as the northern lateral extensions of the maha - mandapa with an entrance on the open side , while the corresponding lateral extension of the same plan on the south , dug into the parent rock , contains the niches of Mahesamurti and other sculptures .
Towards the rear end of the maha - mandapa is a sandhara , chalurmukha shrine , square , and with doors framed by elaborate over - doors on the four sides .
Inside there is a large rock - cut linga pedestal , with its spout on the north , and with an inserted linga .
The Hindu cave at Mahur ( Nander district ) in Maharashtra has a sandhara - iype of sanctum with two smaller transverse corridors in front and two smaller subsidiary shrines on the flanks .
This is apparently a late plan after the model of Caves 17 and 21 of Ellora , and datable to the first quarter of the eighth century .
It was perhaps a provincial contemporary of Dhumarlena of Ellora .
There is an unfinished excavation by the side of the Siva cave .
The cave at Bhokardan near Aurangabad has five shrine - cells in a line behind the pillared rectangular mandapa at the rear of an open cutting in a low outcropping trap rock on the left bank of the Kelna river - bed .
Each cell has a door - opening .
The mandapa has two bays , at the front and the rear , forming mukha - and ardha - mandapas .
It is not clear if this cave is of Western or Eastern Chalukyan authorship ; it could even have been of mixed tradition .
The nature of the sculpture and other evidence indicate an Eastern Chalukyan authorship in the mid - seventh century AD .
The doorways of the shrines are simple like those in the southern cave - temples and unlike the Western Chalukyan - Rashtrakuta types with elaborate over - doors .
While most of the cave - temples are dedicated to Siva , two are definitely dedicated to Durga , and a few to Vishnu .
The sculptural content is very meagre compared to the examples at Badami , Aihole , Ellora , etc .
Among the few sculptures , mention may be made of tandava Siva .
The Anantasayanagudi cave - temple at Undavalli is the largest of the group and is a three - storeyed structure akin to the Ellora Buddhist Caves 11 and 12 , the Do - tal and Tin - tal .
It belongs to the seventh century if not earlier , and was perhaps intended originally for the Buddhist creed , but was adopted later for a Vishnu temple , the principal deity being a recumbent Vishnu , or Anantasayin .
The Bhairavakonda cave - temples are excavated into a soft schist intrusion in the hills at Kottapalle in Nellore district , a rock material different from the Krishna - Guntur group .
Interposed between them , along with two rock sculptures of dancing Siva and Harihara , are small niches or memorial shrines with lingas cut inside them , with dedicatory or other inscriptions of the eighth century .
The eight larger cave - temples fall into two groups .
The first four , starting from the northern end of the horseshoe valley or ravine , are simple shrine excavations without a front mandapa and lack the elaborately decorated kapota cornice and its kudu ornaments .
An early , if imperfect , monolithic shrine form is found in the Tawa cave at Udaigiri ( Vidisha district , Madhya Pradesh ) .
It is more or less a circular monolithic temple cut out of an isolated mass of sandstone rock and carved into a hemisphere mounted on a base and capped by a flat stone in the form of a tawa ( griddle ) which , according to the inscription on it , was fashioned by a minister of Chandragupta .
What is more interesting is the fact that the Pallavas translated into the hard imperishable stone monoliths the various forms of structural vimana temples of brick and timber that were prevalent at the commencement of the seventh century .
Thus they stand out as the earliest examples of the beginnings of vimana architecture in the south , and exhibit the varieties of vimanas that existed , or were evolved at that time .
The variety in form , namely , plan and rise , exemplified by these monoliths , locally called the rathas , would also indicate the existence of well - defined codes and manuals on rituals , art and architecturethe Agama , Silpa and Vastu Sastras .
They thus form the most important landmarks in the study of Indian temple architecture , especially of the south .
As entirely cut - out models , these monoliths show not only the entire external aspect of a vimana from the base to the apex , with the front ardha - mandapa constituting a unitary type of the temple form , but also , to a large extent , as in the cave - temples , the interior aspects .
They were all carved down from the apex to the base as opposed to structural constructions that are built up from the base , or foundation , to the apex .
As , however , according to the traditional ritual the installation of the stupi , or finial , should coincide with the consecration of the temple , after ceremonial installation of the archa murti , or image of worship in the sanctum , the pratishtha and kumbhabhishekam rituals , the stupi was not cut out initially and the work on these monoliths started from the member next below , viz . the sikhara , and a separately carved stupi was inserted into position later on .
The prastaras of both the talas carry arpita haras , applique on the harmya of the second tola and on the griva above , and made up of four karnakutas at the corners and four solas in between them on each side over each face .
The hara at the aditala level is extended also over the top of the ardha - mandapa , a feature of all early vimanas .
The northern ratha of the twin Pidari rathas , facing north with its ardha - mandapa , is of the pure Nagara order , with only this difference that there is no hara over the second talaan advanced featuremaking it out as the last of the series in Mahabalipuram and anticipating in this respect the later vimanas of the eighth century .
Both the rathas lack sculptures on their aditala walls and are incomplete .
The incomplete southern Pidari ratha facing east and the more complete Arjuna ratha are likewise double - storeyed , square in section in both the talas and carrying applique haras of four karnakutas and four salas at both levels .
The griva and sikhara are , however , octagonal in section , making them both ashtanga , nirandhara vimanas of the Dravida order of the composite variety .
There are four nasikas projected from the four cardinal sides of the griva sikhara .
The ardha - mandapa in both the vimanas carries haras of kutas and salas of a smaller size than those over the aditala .
Finding that construction in these hard stones was difficult and time - consuming , and in order to step up the tempo and keep pace with , if not outstrip , his rivals , Rajasimha ultimately resorted to the softstone tradition and had to employ the coarse , friable , local standstones of a not very commendable quality for the temples in his capital city .
The great Kailasanatha temple in Kanchi and others in the same place are of this kind .
However much the Pallavas lagged behind the Chalukyas in this respect , their monolithic or cut - out ratha interlude did confer definite advantages , for it gave them better ideas of form , proportion and design that helped them in making their structural edifices more elegant and better composed and dimensioned than the Chalukyan structural creations .
The Shore temple at Mahabalipuram is a complex of three shrines with accessory mandapas , prakara enclosures and gopura entrances .
Of the three , the larger vimana facing the sea on the east , called Kshatriyasimhesvara , and the smaller vimana at its rear facing the village on the west called Rajasimhesvara , are both dedicated to Siva and have wedged in between them a rectangular mandapa - shrine without a superstructurecalled Narapatisimha Pallava Vishnu - griha .
These names inscribed on the structure are all titles of Rajasimha , the builder of the complex .
The larger eastern vimana has an additional prakara of its own , closely investing it on the east , south and north , and leaving the west open .
Both its tolas are devoid of the hara .
This vimana , called Mahendravarmesvara after Rajasimha ' s son , contains in its sanctum the usual fluted Hnga and Somaskanda panels , besides Brahma and Vishnu sculptures on the inner wall of the ardha - mandapa , as also other sculptures on its outer wall and in the devakoshthas .
The prakara has another entrance on the west at the middle , which is a real gopura entrance with a sola superstructure ; it is smaller in magnitude .
All round the inner face of the prakara is built an array of fifty - eight small dvitala vimanas , all except two being square and of the kuta type .
But among the kuta vimanas of the malika of parivara shrines , those along the east face west , those along the west face east , while those on the north and south both face east .
The external walls of these parivara shrines of the malika contain a variety of sculptures , both Saivite and Vaishnavite , of varied iconography , thus making this temple complex a veritable museum of iconography and plastic art .
The Mahendravarmesvara has a smaller enclosure with a small gopura or dvarasala in front and two lateral entrances in addition near the two front corners .
Thus it was a village moot hall , a santhagara , even as the Ladkhan in Aihole was .
It originally , like the Ladkhan , had a small shrine at the rear , now replaced by a much later one called Vaikuntha - perumal .
The Kontgudi likewise , has a shrine at the rear wall of the hall and with the superstructural scheme added later since the roof shrine has the features of a more evolved Chalukyan vimana roof .
The Meguti of Jain dedication with an inscription dated AD 634 is better evolved .
The walled central bay forms the main sanctum and also carries the roof shrine over it .
The rear bays on either side , close to the hind wall corners , provide for the two lateral shrines of the groundfloor with the two lateral bays in front on the median axial line having flat roofs like the central cell , thus forming their respective ardha - mandapas .
The three mukha - mandapa bays in front as also the corresponding three at the rear have slopy roofs .
Likewise , the two lateral walls of the mandapa are relieved five times , corresponding to the hara elements , the central one on each side being a devakoshtha which is again found on either wing of the front eastern wall on either side of the shrine entrance .
The extreme recesses on the north and south of each lateral face of the mandapa wall have perforated windows .
The second tala is tall , rising as an upward extension of the aditala inner wall .
The third tala of a lesser height over it is also devoid of the hara elements .
In contrast with this group of earlier vimana forms showing different stages of development during the seventh century , we have the full - fledged vimana forms in the temples of Sangamesvara , Virupaksha , and Mallikarjuna in Pattadkal , reflecting to a great extent the vimana features as crystallized in the contemporary Pallava structural temples and their earlier monolithic rathas .
Among these , the temples at Biccavolu ( east Godavari district ) are characteristic .
The Biccavolu series falls into two groups .
The earlier one comprises the temples called Kansaragudi , Nakkalagudi and a third having no local name , all built , perhaps in the time of Gunaga Vijayaditya ( 848 - 891 ) and his successors .
They are all square on plan , three - storeyed tritala Nagara vimanas with four karanakutas and four solas intervening on the aditala and second tola prastaras , without panjaras and devoid of the sukanasika .
These features indicate affinity and proximity to the Pallava type , though their distinct regional and parental Chalukyan traits would be evident from the other features and the general stature of the vimana form .
The makara toranas show great emphasis in their detail , particularly by the addition of a pair of makara heads at the apex of the arch on either side of the finial .
The kudus in the flexed cornice , or kapota , are horseshoe - shaped as in the Pallava and early Chalukyan examples .
The other three temples inside the villagethe Golingesvara , the Cnandrasekhara , and the Rajarajesvarawould belong to the second and later group ( c . 950 - 1050 ) , and the last perhaps to the time of Rajaraja Narendra ( 1019 - 1 % 0 ) .
They are also two - or three - storeyed Nagara vimanas , square on plan , but with their superstructures entirely or partially restored in later times and heavily plastered over , obscuring many original diagnostic features .
Though it is lesser in dimensions , it is more ornate with bold and round sculpture in the niches and cameos of Puranic scenes formed by miniature panels .
The one forming a belt round the base of the vimana walls is noteworthy in that it narrates synoptically the stories of the lives of the sixty - three Saiva Nayanmars according to the work called Periyapuranam .
The larger loose sculptures set in the wall niches and in the malika corridors are in a new medium , namely , a black , polished basalt - like stone , as against the granite of the structure .
They are all sculptures of a fine quality and most of them are now removed and exhibited in the Thanjavur Art Gallery .
The closed maha - mandapa of this east - facing complex has an open porch - like agra - mandapa on its south , with ornately carved pillars having panel sculptures .
The porch mandapa itself is designed to simulate a chariot on wheels drawn by horses , while the flights of steps , fore and aft , have balustrades guarded by elephants .
Outside this gopura is the ornate but small Nandi - mandapa .
Beyond is another outer gopura that fronted a now non - existent outer prakara .
The addition of the devi temple brought into more common vogue the kalyana utsava , or annual ceremonial marriage festival of the god and goddess , for which special kalyana dolotsava ( swing festival ) mandapas with attached yaga - mandapas were built .
The advent of the special Nataraja shrine as part of the sabha - mandapas or nritta - mandapas in Siva temples has already been mentioned earlier .
The other types are the utsava - mandapas for various periodical festivals where the utsava murtis were decorated , worshipped and taken out in procession .
Snapana - or abhisheka - mandapas ( halls for ceremonial bathing rituals ) , vyakarana - mandapas ( halls for exposition and educational purposes ) , ranga - and natyasalas for dance and music , and even atura salas ( hospital mandapas ) came to be added to the temple complex .
All these made the medieval temple of the Tamil land the hub not only of the religious but also of the social , economic and other temporal activities of the community which always centred round the temple .
Their earlier temples such as the Navalinga group and the Kallesvara at Kukkanur near Gadag ( Dharwar district ) , assignable to the latter half of the tenth century , are perhaps the last among the structures that were built of sandstone , and mark the end of the sandstone - trap rock tradition .
They adopted different soft stones , such as the chloritic schist , for their temples during the middle of their period .
The fine cluster of nine temples in a group called the Navalinga temple consists of nine two - or three - storeyed square vimanas , single - walled , and built round the sides and ends of a linear row of three mandapas , all of poor quality sandstone .
In general appearance , but for the characteristic sukanasikas , they resemble the Biccavolu temples of the Eastern Chalukyas .
It had originally a closed navaranga - mandapa in front , though an open mandapa was added later on .
The central bay of the navaranga included within the four central pillars is a square larger than the eight surrounding peripheral bays .
In addition , it has four supporting pillars at the four inner corners of the garbha - griha .
The pilasters on the walls are slender with capitals that have lost their robust shapes .
The proportionate sizes of their components are lost and the abacus , or phalaka , is small and thin .
In the recesses between the bays of the wall occurs the ' decorative pilaster ' a pilaster carrying a shrine front or pavilion on top , as is to be found in the Chola temples of the eleventh century at Thanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram .
The decorative pilaster is framed inside a torana over two shorter pilaster supports .
So the poem goes on , hinting and guessing at the secret bonds that unite at some dim level of subterraneous consiciousness the worlds of nature and of man , until the earth ' s loving hand has wiped away from Ahalya all trace of man - made sin and she rises again from the womb of the great mother , a new - born virgin , bright and beautiful , like the dawn rising over the blue ocean of forgotten memories .
This patriot and lover of his people was the severest critic of the follies of his countrymen .
It is as though Prospero ' s wand suddenly breaks and the wonderful panorama of life and this world seems insubstantial .
Everything must melt away like a shadow . Getting and not getting , they both end in sighs .
Sometimes he feels that in all the loves he has ever known , in this life as in the many past ones , he has been seeking the one true love in many forms , the love of God , the spirit ' s ceaseless search , without its knowing , for its ultimate goal .
The religious consciousness , the need of establishing a satisfactory relationship with the Absolute , which was to find its culmination in the Gitanjali period , is beginning to stir within him .
But the love of life is strong and the mystic consciousness not yet overwhelming .
But nearer home , in the northern regions of the empire , the break is observed to be more pronounced , conditioned not only by the political invasion by iconoclastic rulers of alien faith but also other local and intrinsic causes .
The change - over from a hitherto softstone vogue to one of rather quite novel and less tractable hardstone apart , the models left in the hundreds , though of great merit as great expositions and landmarks in the history of architecture , by the immediate predecessors , the Hoysalas and before them the Western Chalukyas , could not supply the want adequately .
The very peculiarities of their plan and elevation could not afford the starting point for the Vijayanagar series .
Either of them have become cul - de - sacs , so to say , that had taken far away from the main highroad of evolution laid by their precursors , the Rashtrakutas and before them the early Chalukyas and codified in the architectural canons .
For , the emphasis on the horizontal division resulting in the tiered nature of the superstructure was the sine qua non of the recognized southern vimana order .
In such a perspective of the subdual , almost to the extent of obliteration in effect of the horizontal division and stratification , neither could the Hoysala genre satisfy .
The similar but stellate vertical corrugations again extending from the very base to the near apex , more boldly emphasized in the Hoysala genre , could not satisfy the need .
The tempting softness of the stone , coupled with the increased surface area to be carved , resulting from the vertical folds or offsets , had encouraged such profusions of sculpture and embellishment which could not very well be done with equal facility in the hard - stone material that the Vijayanagar artisans took up for their work .
Inside the eastern apse , or the eastern half of the structure is accommodated a large pillared mandapa with twelve peripheral pillars each of which is a huge monolith of the composite character that becomes the feature of Vijayanagar temples to come .
On the outer face of each such caryatid column is cut out the pillai - k - kal or slender columnette attached to the main part only by its base and top , and having all the features of a typical pillar , the potika on top again , being a pushpa potika .
Yet the navarnaga design is betrayed by the raised ceiling with nine coffered bays on top , eight of them surrounding a central larger one .
Inside the open gaps of each one of the vyalas the stone mass has been very dexterously cut out into a round ball which can be rolled inside but not taken out , another feat of sculpture by the craftsman as is common in the Vijayanagar vyala pillars .
The passage outside the ring of the ranga - mandapa pillars and between them and the outer wall has a roof made up of two rising stages , each with an outward slope while that over the central ranga - mandapa the ceiling is raised up still further as a clerestory .
The roofing in this highly rain - soaked region is adequately designed by the laying above of the long channel stones sloping out and placed together , the adjacent parallel edges of every two channels being covered by an inverted channel stone , hood - like .
This pattern is found followed in many other temples of this area and the western coastal strip on the other side of the Ghats .
The large central bay on the ceiling of the ranga - mandapa , inside , thus coming to have a greater depthforming as it were a nabhichchanda vitana , bears a well - defined inverted lotus blossom with many seriate petals and a large pendentive central torus which is pecked by four parrots perched , topsy - turvy , on the petals immediately surrounding the central torus .
The circular srikoyil of Vadakkunnathan , the most northerly of the row , has its sanctum cells divided by a transverse diagonal wall .
The western half enshrining Siva has its own door - Opening and flight of steps in front with a detatched namaskar mandapa in front .
The eastern half is dedicated to devi Parvati with a door opening on the east .
The northern and southern faces have false doors , or ghanadvaras .
Over the moulded stone adhishthana , the outer wall of the sandhara structure and its prastara show the characteristic reliefs of pilasters and miniature shrines of the kuta , sala , and panjara models , as in the Tamil Nadu temples .
The slopy conical roof of metal sheet covers these by its overhanging eaves supported by brackets sprung from the wall at intervals .
The inner wall rising up further actually carries this immense conical roof , or sikhara , with a single metal stupi on top .
The most southernly of the group is the two - storeyed shrine of Rama , square on plan , with its adhishthana , walls , and prastara relieved five times on each of its four faces .
However , on this last occasion , though I again did all in my power to reason with the rebellious soldiery , they would not heed me , and carried out their purpose of slaying these poor people .
If they did so , they may have been urged on to it by Mirza Mughal . "
Bahadur Shah further stated that his signatures on various firmans ( orders ) , and documents were obtained under duress , coercion and without his free will : " As regards the orders under my seal , and under my signature , the real state of the case is , that from the day the soldiery came and killed the European officers , and made me a prisoner , I remained in their power as such .
All papers they thought fit , they caused to be prepared , and , bringing them to me , compelled me to affix my seal .
Sometimes they brought the rough drafts of orders , and had fair copies of them made by my secretary .
At other times , they brought the original letters intended for despatch , and left copies of them in the office .
Hence , several rough drafts in diversity of hands have been filed in the proceedings .
Frequently they had the seal impressed on the outside of empty unaddressed envelopes .
There is no knowing what papers they sent in these or to whom they sent them . "
I prefer to quote from the evidence . "
He further called the King a sovereign , pensioner and a traitor : " That the prisoner was a pensioned subject of the British Government in India and as the British Government neither deprived him nor any member of his family of any sovereignty whatever , but , on the contrary , relieving them from misery and oppression , bestowed on them largesse and pensions aggregating many millions of pounds sterling , this traitor rushed to seize the first possible opportunity of overthrowing and destroying the government of his benefactors .
" He was a sovereign , proclaimed as King and his jurisdiction was paramount in Delhi . "
From the evidence of one Ashan Ulla Khan , a physician , it was sought to be established that when he and Ghulam Abbas , the attorney in the court , were with the King , they were told that the troopers had killed Mrs Fraser and had gone up to Captain Douglas to kill him and that the King ' s servants joined in these murders with the full knowledge of the King .
He submitted that this statement clearly and satisfactorily proved that the King ' s servants were the murderers and the King was a party to it .
He said , " That no servant was ever dismissed and not the slightest investigation or enquiry was ever instituted ; in fact , in the answers to the questions put to the witness , the King continued with these murderers both in his pay and in employment . "
On the first charge , he stated that he would rely upon a firman written by the King to " the special slave , the Lord Governor Muhammad Bakht Khan Bahadur " in his own hand , and various other documents and letters written by others to the King .
Without any hesitation we own the responsibility for publishing .
He further said , " That the issue of the said periodical work of the said 28th day of April , 1883 was made up and published entirely on my responsibility , and to the best of my knowledge , information and belief , the said Ramcoomar Dey did not read anything contained therein in the editorial columns before the publication thereof .
" I further say that , except as an hon ' ble and learned judge of this hon ' ble court , I have no knowledge whatsoever of the said hon ' ble John Freeman Norris , and that in writing and publishing what I did in connection with His Lordship , I acted entirely bona fide and as I believed , in the interests of the public good .
" That there appeared in the said issue of the 28th day of April , 1883 , two paragraphs in connection with the said hon ' ble John Freeman Norris , one at page 194 under the heading of ' News and Notes ' of Tuesday , the 24th day of April , 1883 and the other at page 199 amongst the editorial notes .
" That the Brahmo Public Opinion referred to in the said paragraph is a periodical work published in Calcutta every Thursday , and is believed by the public , and I believe it , to be under the editorship of a gentleman practising as an attorney of this hon ' ble court .
" That the matter of complaint made in the said first paragraph appeared in the said Brahmo Public Opinion , to the best of my knowledge , information and belief , in its issue of Thursday the 19th day of April , 1883 , and no contradiction thereof , nor any explanation thereof appeared either in the said Brahmo Public Opinion or to the best of my knowledge , information and belief in any other newspaper .
" That the matter of complaint made in the said second paragraph appeared in the said Brahmo Public Opinion in its issue of the 26th day of April , 1883 and no explanation or contradiction thereof appeared in that paper , or in any other newspaper , before the publication of the said issue of the said periodical work .
Banerjea claimed " the honour ( for such I deem it ) of being the first Indian of my generation This trial of Surendra Nath Banerjea generated a wave of political consciousness in India and publicity abroad .
He became a hero overnight .
It sowed the seed of the right of freedom of expression and trial of the press to express free and frank comments in the interest of public good .
It challenged the jurisdiction of the court to try for its own contempt .
It established the dictum that even a judge of the High Court has to take care of public sentiments and cannot act in an arbitrary manner .
Interestingly enough , Surendra Nath Banerjea was later made president of the Xlth session of the Indian National Congress .
Born in a Maratha Brahmin family of Ratnagiri , he was educated in the Deccan College , took a degree in law , sponsored the foundation of the Fergusson College and took to journalism to edit two journals ' Maratha ' ( in English ) and ' Kesari ' ( in Marathi ) .
In 1897 , he started the Shivaji festival and tried to revive patriotic fervour amongst the Indians .
His adverse criticism of government measures to fight the plague outbreak in Poona ( Pune ) led to his prosecution and conviction on charge of sedition .
Tilak was prosecuted under Section 124 - A and a lengthy trial took place .
Tilak defended himself and prepared a masterly defence , which is a document of historical importance .
It is in this trial , when asked by the judge whether he had anything to say in his defence , Tilak uttered those memorable words which are today inscribed in the tablet placed at the entrance of the same court - room .
Tilak was sentenced to six years ' transportation to Mandalay in Burma and a fine of Rs 1000 .
The third trial of Tilak took place in the year 1916 , on his release from the six years ' sentence of transportation .
In this trial also he was prosecuted for sedition but no jail sentence was imposed .
The second trial of Tilak in 1908 is of historical importance as it acquired a place in the history of criminal jurisprudence .
Tilak was arrested and made to stand before the Presidency Magistrate to face charges in the preliminary hearing at the Esplanade Court in Bombay .
He was charged under Sections 124 - A and 153 - A of the Indian Penal Code on charges of fomenting sedition and antagonising the masses before the Presidency Magistrate , Mr A . H . S . Aston .
The counsel for Tilak argued that there should be a single trial .
The government advocate pressed for separate trials and the magistrate had no choice of his own but to uphold the government ' s view and ordered separate trials . ^
Tilak was committed to the High Court where such trials used to take place at that time .
Mr M . A . Jinnah ( at that time a nationalist leader and thereafter architect of the present Pakistan ) pleaded in his bail petition that Tilak was under treatment for diabetes and that the translation of Kesari articles , on the basis of which charges had been laid , were full of mistakes and errors .
For accurate translation to be submitted to the court and to enable Tilak to prepare his own defence , it was only just and fair to grant him bail .
He assured the judge that Tilak could be relied upon to appear in court on the date fixed for the hearing .
Mr Jinnah also reminded the judge of the earlier decision of Mr Justice Tyabji when bail in such a matter was granted .
He was not aware that the attitude of the government towards political activists had stiffened during the intervening period and the judiciary was not free from such bias in political cases .
Mr Justice Davar refused to grant bail .
Though Tilak was not a revolutionary and nor did he believe in violent methods , elaborate security arrangements were made to guard him while he was under arrest .
The government moved its troops to control the unprecedented crowd who waited outside to have a glimpse of their beloved leader .
The authorities , fearing protests from the crowd of admirers waiting outside the jail , decided to bring Tilak in the darkness of the night from Dongri Jail to the High Court building to lodge him in a small room converted into a solitary cell , at the top floor of the building .
The government wanted to avoid giving the facility ( help from advocates or jury ) to the accused and arbitrarily shifted the venue of the trial to Bombay High Court to the prejudice of Tilak .
A dispute also arose about the nature of the jury .
The government wanted Tilak to be tried by a special jury to secure his conviction .
The barrister , Joseph Baptista , brilliantly argued against the government ' s insistence on a special jury .
His argument was that the special jury would consist mostly of Europeans and Anglo - Indians who were unable to comprehend and appreciate the original Marathi language of the alleged objectionable articles and their background .
Thus from the very start there would be this prejudice against Tilak because of his alleged attack on their community in his paper .
He argued that it would be a travesty of justice to have a special jury of Europeans and Anglo - Indians for a case under Section 153 - A of the I . P . C , i . e . for the charge of antagonising the masses .
It seemed to him wrong that the child , instead of being encouraged to express himself freely and happily in his mother tongue , should be forced from an early age to master the intricacies of aforeign idiom , thus expending all the resources of his tender and undeveloped mind in trying to balance himself of crutches , meanwhile forgetting the use of his limbs .
He had not forgotten his own school days when " we had to sit inert , like dead specimens of some museum , whilst lessons were pelted at us from on high , like hailstones on flowers . "
He imbibes with his limbs and with his senses long before he learns with his brain .
He must therefore be provided with an environment which will stimulate and feed his curiosity and make his introduction to the world around him easy and joyful .
He should be encouraged to do things for himself and should lean as little as possible on his teacher .
The art of teaching so as to enable the child to love and understand his environment and to learn with his limbs and his senses before the brain is unduly taxed was first developed at Santiniketan long before Mahatma Gandhi adapted its basic principle to his system of what later came to be known in India as Basic Education .
The best teacher , according to Tagore , is nature .
Education in the sciences , in which he greatly believed , must arise naturally from the study of nature and the training of the senses , which develop the child ' s curiosity and his aptitudes .
In 1897 , plague ravaged Poona , and Rand , the oppressive of - ficer - in - charge , was murdered by the Chaphekar brothers who went to the gallows singing verses from the ' Gita ' .
Young Savarkar , deeply impressed , took an oath to fight like the Chaphekars for India ' s freedom .
Next year it was expanded into the ' Mitra Mela ' .
In 1902 , Vinayak joined the Fergusson College , Poona , and lived in its residency .
He gathered round him a band of young patriots .
In 1905 , tlie partition of Bengal roused a countrywide protest . Savarkar ' s group organised a bonfire of foreign cloth at Poona for which he was expelled from the college residency .
After graduating in 1905 , Vinayak toured extensively to gain support for his ' Mitra Mela ' society which was now called ' Abhinav Bharat ' .
In 1906 , on Tilak ' s recommendation , Vinayak secured Shyam Krishna Verma ' s scholarship and sailed for England .
It involved important legal issues on international as well as national laws .
Savarkar had purpose in life and it was to liberate his motherland from the foreign yoke by all means .
The great patriot , revolutionary and freedom fighter , Savarkar , since his student life used to take part in political activities and was an active member of Abhinav Bharati , a society in Poona which was engaged in fighting for India ' s freedom .
While taking an active part in political activities , Savarkar decided to go to England and bring before the British people , and the world at large , the injustice against the Indian people in the form of repression and exploitation .
He was a brilliant student , but was not in a position to go abroad at his own .
While studying law fit : Bombay , he heard about scholarships offered by a great Indian patriot , Shyam Krishna Verma , a barrister settled in England , to needy Indian students desirous of studying abroad .
Savarkar reached London in 1906 and devoted himself to his studies .
He also directed his energy to political activities and actively associated with the Indians who propagated ideas against the British rule and supported revolutionary activities in India .
The Brigadier had seized Savarkar by one arm for the purpose of taking him back to the ship and the prisoner went peace - " fully with him .
The Brigadier did not release his hold till they reached the deck of the vessel .
It would appear that the incident did not occupy more than a few minutes .
It is alleged that the Brigadier was not ignorant of the presence of Savarkar on board the vessel and that his orders , like those of the French police and Gendarmes , were to prevent any Hindu from coming on shore who had not got a ticket .
These circumstances show that the persons on board in charge of Savarkar might well have believed that they could count on the assistance of the French police .
" It is established that a Commissaire of the French police came on board the vessel shortly after its arrival and , in accordance with the orders of the Prefect , placed himself at the disposal of the Commander in respect of the watch to be kept .
In consequence of this , the Commissaire was put in communication with the British police officer - in - charge of the prisoner .
The court held :
" Whereas , having reacted to what has been stated , it is manifest that the case is not one of recourse to fraud or force in order to obtain possession of a person who had taken refuge in a foreign country , and that there was not in the circumstances of the arrest and delivery of Savarkar to the British authority and of his removal to India anything in the nature of the violation of the sovereignty of France , and that all those who took part in the matter certainly acted in good faith and had no thought of doing anything unlawful .
" Whereas , in the circumstances cited above , the conduct of the Brigadier , not having been disclaimed by his chiefs before the morning of July 9 , i . e . before the " MOREA " left Marseilles , the British police might naturally have believed that the Brigadier had acted in accordance with his instructions or that his conduct had been approved .
" Whereas , while admitting that an irregularity was committed by the arrest of Savarkar and by his being handed over to the British police , there is no rule of International Law imposing , in circumstances such as those which have been set out above , any obligation on the power , which has in its custody a prisoner , to restore him because of a mistake committed by the foreign agent who delivered him to that power . "
The judgment of the Tribunal shocked the world as it made mockery of the established right of asylum as cited in International Law .
Hamelin in L ' affairs Savarkar ( Extrait de Recueil general de Jurisprudence , de Doctrine , et de Legislation colo - niales , 1911 ) , defended the French view .
The award of the Court of Arbitration was severely criticised by Baty in Law Magazine and Review , 36 ( 1911 ) , pp . 326 , 330 and by other wates of International Law .
Oppenheim in International Law ( vol . 1 , 8th edition , p . 703 has given a summary of the case France vs . Great Britain .
Some members of the British Parliament also criticised the judgment of The Hague court .
A well - known journal , Sociologist , published in Europe by an Indian patriot , Shyam Krishna Verma , commented :
" The decision of the International Tribunal at The Hague has shattered all faith in the maintenance of the rights of political refugees as ordinarily understood and it is sad to observe that the nations , hitherto most conspicuous for their love of liberty , are slow to recognise these rights when they are beset by political considerations .
L . Humanite was after all justified in finding that the submission of L ' affairs to arbitration in the first instance was a tactical error on the part of France and a friend , who was a member of the British Parliament , assures us that the way in which France submitted her case ensured its failure , all the strongest grounds having been omitted . "
It was commented upon by Dr Oppenheim , authority on International Law in the following words : " This judgment reduces the right of asylum to very narrow limits .
According to the judgment , to put the matter in its extreme form , a Prince called Kropotkin might conceivably be kidnapped by Russian agents in collusion with British police and without the knowledge or consent of the British Government and no rule of International Law could be invoked for his restoration .
The decision serves to emphasise the urgent need for the establishment , as supplementary to the Arbitration Courts at The Hague of a permanent court of International Law , from which , not negative compromises , but sensible authoritative judgments could be obtained . "
Thus ended the trial of a great patriot and revolutionary , who loved his motherland and risked his life for its liberation from the opressive British rule .
The trial also left an imprint of Savar - kar ' s personality on International Law , and the footprints of a champion of liberty who heroically strove for the deliverance of a suppressed people .
Its impact was so great that it hastened the fall of M . Briand , the French premier , who was compelled to resign after The Hague court verdict .
Mohandas Karatnchand Gandhi was born at Porbandar in Gujarat on 2nd October , 1869 .
He was the youngest of three sons and had one sister .
His father , Karamchand Uttamchand , was Prime Minister of Rajkot .
Gandhi was in school till 1887 .
Gandhi was married in 1881 to Kasturbai .
After spending nine months in a college , he left for England in September , 1888 to study law .
He returned home in 1891 and set himself up as a lawyer .
In April 1893 , Gandhi was called to Natal in the service of a merchant named Seth Abdulla .
Soon after arrival , he experienced in person the harsh treatment meted out to coloured people by the Whites .
There he also read Tolstoy ' s The Kingdom of God is within " You ' , and was deeply impressed by the latter ' s writings .
Gandhi returned to India on 19 December , 1914 and after an interrupted stay in Santiniketan in February - March , 1915 , collected his companions of Phoenix ' and established the Satyagraha Ashram in Ahmedabad city on 25 May , 1915 .
This was shifted in June , 1917 to the banks of the Sabarmati river opposite the city .
Between 1917 and 1918 , Gandhi participated in two movements in Champaran ( Bihar ) and Kaira ( Gujarat ) and in the labour dispute in Ahmedabad itself .
World War I ended on 11 November , 1918 ; and this was followed in India by the proposal of the Rowlatt Bills designed to curb the rising tide of sedition .
Gandhi reacted sharply against the oppressive measures and stood forth as the leader of the resurgent Indian nationalism .
From 1924 to 1929 , Gandhi devoted himself largely to the constructive programmes and undertook several ' satyagraha ' movements .
In 1924 he was elected president of the Indian National Congress .
Detailed studies have been undertaken on his philosophy of life and on his political , social , religious and economic ideas .
Gandhi has been looked upon by many primarily as a man of religion ; by others , as a leader of Indian nationalism .
He was very regular and methodical in his habits , and austere in his style of living .
Gandhi respected the sincere religious beliefs of every individual , and in his dealings with men and women he was deeply humane , and would do all to alleviate the sufferings of those who came to him for succour .
" A . I only want to state that when the proper time comes , I shall plead ' guilty ' so far as disaffection towards government is concerned .
It is true that I am the editor of Young India , that the articles read in my presence were written by me and that the proprietors and publishers permitted me to control the whole of the policy of the paper .
It was recorded in the proceedings that accused No . 1 did not wish to call any defence witnesses and that he had no objection if the trial in the Sessions Court proceeded without delay .
Accused No . 2 refused to call any defence witnesses and requested the court to take up the case soon .
The learned magistrate passed the following order under Section 213 :
" The accused have been charged with promoting sedition by certain articles published in Young India of which accused No . 1 is the editor and accused No . 2 the printer .
" I , L . N , Brown , Additional District Magistrate hereby charge you , Mohandas Kamrachand Gandhi as follows :
" That you being the editor of the paper young India on or about 29th day of September , 1921 , the 15th day of December , 1921 and the 23rd day of February , 1922 at Ahmedabad did write the words contained in the appendix to this charge and by these written words did bring or attempt to bring into hatred or contempt or did excite or did attempt to excite disaffection towards His Majesty or the government established by law in British India and thereby committed offences punishable under Section 124 - A of the Indian Penal Code and within the cognisance of the Court of Sessions .
The pent - up emotion of the people burst in a storm of sorrow as a long , slow procession moved towards him in a mournful pilgrimage of farewell , clinging to the hands that had toiled so incessantly , bowing over the feet that had journeyed so continuously in the service of his country .
The final scene of the trial yet remained : the farewell of friends and followers who , in single file , went past him and for each of whom Gandhiji had a kind word or a friendly jest .
The leave - taking took nearly an hour .
The military officers were waiting with a car for Gandhiji .
At about two o ' clock , Gandhiji entered the car with Kasturba , Pandit Malaviya , Banker and Mrs Naidu .
The anxious crowds standing outside the Circuit House attempted to shout their reverential cry of ' Mahatma Gandhi ki jai ' , but Gandhiji stopped it with a sign of his finger .
The curtain fell finally but only after India ' s message of truth and nonviolence had been recorded on the sheets of history .
Strangely one of the principal grounds advanced by the prosecution for rejecting bail applications and accepted by the magistrate was that the case had been started by the Government of India after due care and therefore the accused were in all likelihood guilty , and as such not entitled to bail .
The preliminary enquiry commenced before Mr Milner White , special magistrate , at the district court of Meerut .
In his opening address he emphasised the role of Moscow and the Third International in carrying on communist propaganda in India .
Giving a detailed description of the origin , objectives , organisation , methods and tactics of the Third International , he said that a large number of people connected with the Bolshevik movement had " indulged in ruthless bloodshed and a reign of terror " at the direction of the Third International . And according to the " programme of this body in Moscow , violence , bloodshed and civil war and reign of terror were unavoidable . "
In addition , the prosecution pointed out the role of various Moscow controlled and directed front agencies such as the Red International of Labour Unions , the National Minorities Movement and the League against Imperialism for furtherance of communism in India .
Besides stressing the subversive character of the Comintern in the entrire non - communist world , Mr James pointed out that the communists in Russia had oppressed their own people and were now bent on annihilating the social structure of India , notably the so - called national bourgeoisie .
They made vigorous efforts to capture the Trade Union Congress in 1927 and last year , they persistently adhered to the Moscow clique .
The sentences were reduced considerably .
Hutchinson and eight others were completely acquitted .
The High Court , taking into consideration the fact that the defendants had already been confined for more than four years , tried to be lenient .
In the Sessions Court the prosecution evidence took over 13 months . 3 .
The arguments continued for over four - and - a - half months . 6 .
The hearing of arguments started on 24th July , 1933 . 8 .
The trial was a farce throwing all established legal norms and procedures to the winds .
Sardar Bhagat Singh Bhagat Singh was born to Kishan Singh and Vidyavati at Banga in the Lyallpur district of the West Punjabi in 1907 ( exact date of birth is not known ) .
On completion of his primary education at the village school in Banga , Bhagat Singh was sent to the D . A . V . College at Lahore .
From 1923 to the time of his execution in 1931 , Bhagat Singh worked for the liberation of his motherland .
In 1925 he founded the Nav Jazvan Bharat Sabha at Lahore to inculcate a spirit of revolution among the youth .
He came in touch with other revolutionaries like Sukhdev , Yashpal , Chandra Shekhar Azad , Jatindra Nath Das and others , who were also working among the youth .
When the Simon Commission landed in Bombay on 3rd February , 1928 , the Congress gave a call of black flag demonstration against it .
Lala Lajpat Rai suffered grave bodily injuries . He succumbed to his injuries and , barely a fortnight after the incident , died on 17th November , 1928 .
Bhagat Singh took upon himself to avenge this national insult with ' blood for blood .
On 17th December , 1928 , Bhagat Singh with his two close associates , Rajguru and Azad , reached the office of Mr Scott , the Deputy Superintendent of Police .
Bhagat Singh and his comrades took their pre - planned positions in the office which was located in the Punjab Central Secretariat .
After some time , an Englishman came out of the office .
Jai Gopal , one of Bhagat Singh ' s comrades , mistook him for Mr Scott .
Actually he was J . P . Saunders , Assistant Superintendent of Police .
The moment Saunders started his motorcycle and rode out of the gate on to the road at 4.20 p . m . , at the awaited signal from Jai Gopal , Raj Guru fired at Saunders hitting him in the neck .
The nation rejoiced at Saunders ' shooting for it was not an act of terrorism or violence , but an act to vindicate the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai , and through him , that of the entire nation .
" Both Bhagat Singh and B . K . Dutt looked cheerful and kept smiling all along .
Contrary to the procedure in the court , they were seated handcuffed behind an iron railing on a bench .
Behind them , sat the jail official and some C . I . D . men . "
Eleven prosecution witnesses ( all belonging to the government ) were examined that day .
Not a single independent witness was there .
When the court rose for lunch , Bhagat Singh ' s family was allowed to meet him in the presence of police officials .
During the interview , Bhagat Singh was heard telling his father again and again that the government was bent on sending him to the gallows and that the father should not be anxious about him .
But , now the request was turned down with the court pleading that it was not bound to follow any precedent .
The statement ended with the slogan , ' Long Live the Revolution ' .
The hearing of the case ended on 10th June , 1929 and the judgment was announced on the 12th .
Delivering the judgment , the Sessions Judge charged :
" The accused admit throwing bombs in the Assembly chamber .
" They allege that the prosecution evidence regarding the seizure of the pistol is false , and that some of the prosecution evidence regarding the throwing of bombs is also false .
" They affirm that they hold human life sacred and state that they dropped the bombs as a protest and as a warning .
They had no grudge or malice against any one of the persons injured ; they refer to the damage caused by the bombs which they characterise as slight and affirm that it was their intention that no serious damage would result .
" I accept the direct and oral evidence produced before me as cogent proof that Bhagat Singh and Dutt , each threw bombs into the Assembly chamber , that Bhagat Singh fired a pistol and that Dutt scattered leaflets in the chamber .
The facts which are essential to the charges are that each of the accused threw a bomb and I find it proved that each of them did so .
It started on 10th July , 1929 .
In this case , 27 persons were involved .
Out of 27 , six were at large and could not be traced .
Of the remaining 18 , three were discharged under various Sections .
The remaining 15 , including Phonindra Nath Ghosh and Bhagat Singh , were put on trial .
The first two were found unreliable and the prosecution case rested mainly on the evidence of the remaining five approvers .
All the accused who stood trial were young .
They knew what was going to happen and hence decided not to take the case seriously and adopted an attitude of total indifference .
Various methods were devised by Bhagat Singh and his comrades to mock the court and its proceedings .
The tactics adopted by Bhagat Singh included singing of revolutionary songs , raising slogans during the proceedings with his comrades joining in and thus , obstructing the proceedings of the court , which , in their opinion , was just a farce .
" First charge : The accused No . 1C 58 Captain Shah Nawaz Khan , I / 14th Punjab Regiment , No . 1C 226 Captain P . K . Sehgal , 2 / 10th Baluch Regiment , and No.1C 336 Lt . Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon , 1 / 14th Punjab Regiment , all attached to C . S . D . I . C . ( i ) Delhi , Indian commissioned officers , charged with murder in Malaya , at Rangoon , in the vicinity of Popa , in the vicinity of Kyaukpadaung , and elsewhere in Burma , between the month of September , 1942 and the 26th day of April , 1945 did wage war against His Majesty the King Emperor of India .
" Second charge : Indian Army Act , Section 41 ( against the said Lt . Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon alone ) .
" Fourth charge : I . A . A . Section 41 ( against the said Lt . Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon alone ) .
Committing a civil offence , that is to say murder , contrary to Section 302 , I . P . C . in that he ( Lt . Dhillon ) at or near Popa Hill in Burma , on or about 16th March , 1945 , by causing the death of Duli Chand , did commit murder .
" Fifth charge : I . A . A . Section 41 ( against the said Captain P . K . Sehgal alone ) .
" Sixth charge : I . A . A . Section 41 ( against the said Lt . Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon alone ) .
Committing a civil offence , that is to say , murder contrary to Section 302 , I . P . C . in that he ( Lt . Dhillon ) at or near Popa Hill in Burma , on or about 6th March , 1945 , by causing the death of Daryao Singh , did commit murder .
In terms of language of the book on International Law , the liability is on the State under whose direction they fought , and such liability in International Law on the occasion of hostilities does not exist .
Of course , if a rebellion is successful , then it becomes a new government , and that is the end of it and the answer is given in my client ' s favour by International Law . "
Bhulabhai Desai went straight to the heart of the matter ( the subject people ' s right to revolt ) when he said , " In the situation in which an Indian finds himself , the question is under what circumstances and to what extent the question of allegiance can be raised at all , because once you divide the King from the country , it becomes a very difficult issue altogether tot any human being to decide , and hence I would prefer to rest my argument on the occurrences of 17th February .
" The position of an Indian in a case of this kind is difficult and I am going to submit to the court on first principle what its true solution is .
Where the King and the country coincide there is no question of an alternative .
If you fight against the King and also fight against the interests of your own country , the question does not arise but the question does arise where there is a fight for freedom , and I propose to read passages to show to what extent the world has progressed in the matter of the recognition of human rights .
When you are formally fighting to liberate the country , then the point is whether the question of allegiance can arise at all .
Unless you sell your own soul , how can you ever say that when you are fighting to liberate your own country , there is some other allegiance which prevents you from so doing ?
That means that , if that happens , there is nothing but permanent slavery . "
He continued that modern International Law had recognised the right of subject races , not at the moment independent , to so organise as to fight for their liberation .
Shri Asaf Ali , prominent advocate from Delhi assisted by Shri Jia Lal Kilam and other advocates appeared in court to defend Sheikh Abdullah .
Sheikh Abdullah delivered all his speeches in the Kashmiri language except for one which was in Urdu .
The prosecution relied on various extracts from the speeches as taken down in long hand by C . I . D . s , translated and submitted by them to the State government .
The complaint is quoted below which shows that incorrect translations were used to frame charges under Section 124 - A to silence the voice of the people and curb freedom movement in the State :
That the accused with the object and intention of bringing into hatred and contempt His Highness the Maharaja Bahadur and the Government of Jammu and Kashmir , as established by law , and with a view to exciting disaffection towards His Highness the Maharaja Bahadur and the Government of Jammu and Kashmir as established by law convened public meetings of the National Conference in different parts of Srinagar city and its suburbs on 9th , 10th , 13th , 14th and 16th of May , 1946 ( and in many other places as well ) in which he addressed the assembled people .
" Three parts of India are under the direct control of the British and one - fourth is indirectly under them .
In these parts , ten crore human beings live as slaves .
We will put an end to the rule of the Dogra Shahi . ( 14th May , I960 ) . " c ) And in his speeches of 16th May , 1946 , the following passages occur : " What do Hindus , Muslims and Sikhs of the State want ?
They do not want to fall prey to the life of luxury of Rajas and Maharajas .
Forty lakh people are falling prey to the luxury of one man .
" I address those Hindus who laud the Dogra Raj to tell them what this Raj is , Its foundation is built on shameful treachery .
Today in 1946 , I will take revenge of this shameful treachery from the descendants of Maharaja Gulab Singh .
Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah 181 " He prophesied that time will come when , from the graves of Kashmir the dead will rise from the coffins and shout ' Dogra Raj Murdabad ' .
No force , no conspiracy can keep these people in slavery .
" The decision for freedom from slavery has to be taken by us by our blood .
" Revolt is the right of a slave .
" After three hundred years , we will put an end to this Dogra Raj .
This is a , sacred war .
Exhort people to join this war .
Those who waste the wealth of the people earned by their blood and sweat on dogs and horses kre worse than tyrants .
It is the duty of every man to break away from their trap . " 3 .
The prosecution submitted that the above - men - tioned speeches in general and the particular passages noted , are calculated to bring into hatred and contempt and excite disaffection to - wards His Highness Maharaja Bahadur and the Government of Jammu and Kashmir as estab - lished by law and as such , come within the purview under Section 124 - A R . P . C . 4 .
That before , during and after the meeting , among other things slogans were raised as a direct consequence of excitement of feelings caused by the speeches .
These slogans have no other significance and effect except that of hatred and contempt against the ruler and the family . 5 .
The prosecution examined 26 witnesses in support of the charge .
Most of the witnesses were police and C . I . D . men and officers .
Some of them were not well versed in their knowledge of English language who took down the speeches and translated the same into English .
It was clear from the beginning that the State and the court were anyhow bent upon convicting Sheikh Abdullah .
The speeches were torn out of context and the entire prosecution was based on notes of such speeches .
Though badly translated , the speeches show the rare courage of a fighter who stood up to and spoke against British Raj and that of the Maharaja , his atrocities and misrule .
Sheikh Abdullah courageously admitted that he had made the inflammatory speeches and that he stood by what he said .
This has attracted the penal and preventive provisions of law .
Where law is not based on will of the people , it can lend itself to the suppression of their aspirations .
Such law has no moral validity even though it may be enforced for a while .
To that law I gladly submit arid that Tribunal I shall face with confidence and without fear , leaving it to history and posterity to pronounce their verdict on the claims I and my colleagues have made not merely on behalf of the four million people of Jammu and Kashmir , but also of the ninety - three million people of all the States of India .
That claim has not been confined to the people of a particular race , or religion or colour . It applies to all , for I hold that humanity as a whole is indivisible by such barriers and human rights must always prevail .
" Some allegations have been made that ' Quit Kashmir ' and the demand for the abrogation of the Treaty of Amritsar have communal or communist inspiration .
This is a travesty of fact and I deny and repudiate these allegations .
The National Conference is essentially a national organisation including in its fold all people who . agree with its objective and co - operate with the All India States People ' s Conference , with which it is affiliated .
It stands also for social and economic changes to end privileges and to raise the masses . "
While concluding his submission before the Sessions Court , Sheikh Abdullah uttered these memorable words :
" It is a small matter whether I am imprisoned and tried and convicted .
Then only shall we be worthy of the land we dwell in . "
His defence statement depicted the sorry plight of the people of Kashmir due to autocratic misrule by the Do - gras , who had bought the State and were misusing its revenue .
The public prosecutor submitted that the charges had been proved and that the Sheikh should be awarded the maximum punishment .
Mr Asaf Ali , defence counsel , made a memorable speech in defence .
He began : " For a variety of reasons , both instrinsic and extrinsic , this trial has become what will probably go down in history as a memorable trial , and particularly in the chequered history of Kashmir .
The importance which this case has acquired both in legal history and the hstory of this State , and I make bold to say also in the history of India as a whole , is fully reflected by the fact that great personalities of India like Mahatma Gandhi , Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru , Maulana Abul Kalam Azad , Sardar Vallabhai Patel have somehow or the other been brought within the orbit of this case because they have taken interest in its development and successful defence .
It is a well - known fact that even His Excellency the Viceroy and His Highness , the Chancellor of the Chamber of Princes , were also apprised on the existence of this case and they have , it is believed , taken notice of it .
And as far as general public interest is concerned , the space which has been devoted to the reports of this case in the press is a fair measure of the deep interest the vast educated population of India has taken in it .
It is also a historic trial in this sense .
Sir , in it are involved deep fundamental issues .
It is not a simple case of sedition ; if it were a simple case of sedition , the prosecution themselves would have kept themselves strictly within the limits of the law of sedition and would have ended the case within three days .
It seemed to them to turn upon an issue which goes to the very root of the Constitution of the State .
In it is involved the great issue of the fundamental rights of the people , not only of this State but also of all the Indian States . "
Asaf Ali then attacked the prosecution witness and evidence :
" The prosecution here challenges this right of the people to raise their voice in assertion of their fundamental rights .
The entire essence of the speeches delivered by the accused from the 6th to the 16th is none else but this .
What is it that he is demanding ?
He is demanding a responsible and representative government , a government which is conducted by the people for the people .
Is this an unreasonable demand ?
Today , in this year 1946 , when the British cabinet has declared that India has the right to be free and if India elects to sever her connection with the British Empire she will be within her rights .
At a time the whole world is thinking in terms of the freedom of the people , is it a crime to say that basis of the government of this State should be the will of the people and not a treaty which is 100 - years old and which is impugnable in the highest international court of justice ?
It is the voice of human conscience .
It is the voice of the people .
Sheikh Abdullah is only a symbol of the people ' s undeniable aspirations and rights .
What he is saying now will be repeated time and again and it will go down in history .
Therefore , I maintain that if this is held to be a criminal utterance it will be a grave infringement of the rights of the people and of what is known in constitutional law as ' inherent sanction ' or the people ' s will . "
On relying upon the torn out - of - context sentences from the speeches by the prosecution , he said :
" Pausing upon some sentence is not the way to judge the effect of the speeches ; this principle has been upheld by your own Board of Judicial Advisors in a very recent judgment , in the case of Premnath Bazaz .
I shall only refer to the appropriate and relevant portion of this judgment .
It says , ' In considering the articles in question in the light of the above judicial pronouncements , it is necessary to remember the words of Fitzgerald J . in Reg . vs . Sullivan that they should be dealt with in a fair and liberal spirit , not picking out an objectionable sentence here or a strong word there or giving an undue importance to inflated and turbid language but looking at the real intention and spirit of the article ' .
" It is also to be remembered that mere abusive epithets , declamations , invectives , turbid language will not necessarily bring the writing in question under condemnation .
" What really counts is whether on perusal of the articles as a whole , one can come to the conclusion that they have the tendency to create a feeling of hatred or contempt or disaffection against the government established by law , in the mind of the ordinary average man who reads the newspaper . "
Then he analysed the language of Section 124 - A R . P . C . and said : " The language of Section 124 - A Ranjit Penal Code , if read literally , even with the explanations attached to it , would suffice to make a surprising number of persons in this country guilty of sedition ; no one however supposes that it is to be read in this literal sense .
What then are these general principles ?
We are content to adopt the words of a learned judge , which are to be found in every book dealing with this branch of the criminal law .
" Sedition embraces all those practices , whether by word , deed or writing , which are calculated to disturb the tranquility of the State and lead ignorant persons to subvert the government .
All these spheres constitute the biosphere .
In the biosphere , apart from human beings , plants , animals , birds , fishes and insects , micro - organisms ( such as algae , bacteria and virus ) also exist .
The atmosphere provides oxygen , while the hydrosphere and lithosphere are responsible for water , food and space .
Whenever a change , physical or chemical , occurs in the atmosphere and / or hydrosphere as well as the lithosphere , all living beings get affected .
This change is termed as pollution and the agents that institute these changes are called pollutants .
It was only after the industrial revolution that pollution slowly increased .
This in turn has endangered man as well as the flora and fauna around him .
In Singapore noise has caused a variety of physical and psychological stresses .
Suicides and fits of madness in overcrowded apartments are often attributed to neighbour ' s radios , construction machinery and traffic noise .
The day is not far when we in India may face a similar situation .
The prime cause of pollution is the growing population .
An increase of 2.4 billion just within two decades has led to the fast depletion of resources and generation of more wastes .
With all sorts of pollution around , man continues to live without sparing any thought for it .
- Flakt None can forget one of the most tragic industrial accidents that occurred at Bhopal on 3 December , 1984 .
Deadly gas from a chemical plant operated by Union Carbide escaped into the atmosphere , killing over 4,000 local residents and rendering blind and crippling a large section of the city ' s surviving population .
Not only Bhopal but now every city , every town , every corner of the earth is facing such a crucial problem .
Every day , every moment we breathe polluted air to become a victim of air pollution .
A man can live without food for a month , without water for two or three days , but he cannot live without breathing even for a minute .
It is estimated that an average adult male exchanges 15 kg of air a day , in comparison to about 1.5 kg of the food consumed and 2.5 kg of water intake .
It is obvious that the quantum of pollutants that enter our body through respiration would be manifold in comparison to those taken in through polluted water or contaminated food .
Air is a mixture of gases comprising 78 per cent nitrogen , 21 per cent oxygen and a little less than 1 per cent argon , together with 0.03 per cent carbon dioxide .
As long as this composition is maintained , the air is pure .
A major reason for the increase in air pollution is the rising number of motor vehicles and the two coal - based thermal power plants that operate within city limits .
Of the total emission load of around 2,090 tonnes per day , about 1,320 tonnes ( 60 per cent of total emission ) are due to automobile exhaust , with the result that the wide roads of Delhi are choked .
The gravest of all the effects is the settlement of exhaust fumes , especially during winter months , causing severe respiratory disorders . "
The severity of air pollution at Calcutta is in no way lesser than that of other cities .
Calcutta is considered one of the most polluted cities in the world .
The ambient air of Calcutta contains the highest SPM of 410 hg / m in comparison to 360 hg / m in Teheran , 255 hg / m in Athens and 23 hg / m in London .
Madras too is one of the four metropolises to suffer the consequence of polluted air , though the greatest effect can be felt in north Madras where the industries are clustered .
Hyderabad is severely affected by polluted air with massiv . e clouds of smoke and exhaust fumes spreading over 194 sq kms of the city and its neighbourhood .
The quantity of pollutants discharged by automobile exhausts is estimated to be about 450 tonnes per day and the sky is always grey , such that a resident of the city cannot see the stars clearly even with the aid of a telescope .
An interesting point to note is that the amount of lead in blood is higher in smokers than in non - smokers .
Among the particulate pollutants asbestos needs a special mention .
The use of asbestos has increased severalfolds during the last 30 years .
Used primarily as roofing material for buildings , and for insulating brake and clutch linings in automobiles , asbestos content in the air has also increased .
Another dreaded disease caused by polluted air ( containing dust particles ) is silicosis .
Silicosis is the most common dust - related disease .
Workers in mines , and in industries like that of pottery , ceramics , granite carving and sand blasting , run a risk of contacting this disease which in the early stages shows no subjective symptoms but gradually leads to cough and shortness of breath .
Silicosis is often combined with tuberculosis .
Effects on Plants Air pollutants affect the plants directly through the leaves and stems .
This indirect attack is through the roots when solids acidified with pollutants are absorbed .
They interact with other plant stresses such as frost or drought and aggravate the condition .
Trees and shrubs are reportedly drying in the gardens of the Imperial Palace in Japan .
In northern Bohemia , Federal Republic of Czechoslovakia , polluted air from the brown - coal belt has caused blight in agricultural areas and has heavily damaged forests .
There are three pollutants of prime concern to agriculturists , viz . sulphur dioxide , fluorine compounds and smog .
When only a few cells are injured , a portion of the leaf becomes brownish red in colour or the original green colour becomes bleached .
This effect is known as chlorosis .
In the same year he echoed the sentiment in a famous song which is today the national anthem of India .
All the pain and suffering , the bereavements and rebuffs , the struggles and mortifications , both in the world outside and in his mind , which Rabindranath , who had begun his career as a carefree singer , went through in the first decade of this century were finally resolved and sublimated in the songs that poured forth from his full and chastened heart in 1909 and 1910 and published as Gitanjali in the latter year .
Fifty - one of these 157 songs were later translated by him into English and published in the English book of that name which made him world - famous .
They are too well - known to need any introduction or commentary here .
Ornaments would mar our union ; they would come between Thee and me ; their jingling would drown our whispers . "
Love of God and love of man , strength in sorrow and humility in joy , an innocent wonder that hides centuries of thought , invest these songs with an appeal that is both universal and perennial .
The very first song ( of the original Bengali volume ) strikes the keynote of the poet ' s mood : " May I never celebrate myself in my achievement !
Dr Rosalie Bestell views this problem from another angle .
She suggests that depletion of the ozone layer is a direct consequence of space probes and not just due to chlorofluorocarbons ( CFC ) released by aerosol cans and the refrigeration industry .
She says that every time a rocket is fired into space , 70 - 150 tonnes of chlorine is dumped in the atmosphere .
In the eighties , about 500 rockets and space shuttles were sent up every year ; by 1989 , the figure had reached 1,500 .
Thinning of the ozone layer could also be due to the presence of oxides of nitrogen , especially nitric oxide which is discharged from supersonic aircraft and from automobile exhausts .
Extensive use of nitrates as fertilisers leads to the production of large quantities of nitrous oxide which subsequently gets converted into nitric oxide .
Nitric oxide attacks the ozone ( 03 ) to convert it into oxygen .
It is reported that the doubling of chlorofluorocarbons will warm the globe by 0.5C and lead to the severe consequences already discussed ,
There are 66 thermal power stations in India which generate about 30 - 40 million tonnes of fly ash per annum or 1 lakh tonnes per day .
With the expected increase in power plants and their capacity , the tonnage of fly ash is estimated to reach about 3.5 lakhs tonnes a day .
Such enormous amounts of fly ash should not be wasted , but converted into useful materials .
Research is being carried out to convert the fly ash into Portland - Pozzolona cement , concrete blocks , bricks and cellular concrete .
Old engines and equipments increase the quantum of smoke and fumes .
These have to be either set right or if possible , replaced with new ones .
It must be made mandatory that each and every industry likely to pollute air must install air pollution control equipments such as arresters , scrubbers and filters .
Thermal power plants and other industries releasing fly ash need to incorporate electrostatic precipitators in their process stream itself .
Mere adoption of pollution control measures is not enough .
The Bhopal gas tragedy , described as the ' catastrophe of the century ' , claimed over 4,000 lives and maimed many thousands .
Several thousands lost their eyesight .
Who is to be blamed for such a catastrophe ?
How did such a tragic accident occur ?
The lethal methyl isocyanate ( MIC ) that had sneaked from the storage tanks of Union Carbide ' s pesticide manufacturing unit was the culprit .
The leaking MIC mingled with the ambient air and poisoned it .
The poisoned air sprawled and spread its tentacles to hook the lives of human beings , cattle and birds in the vicinity of the Union Carbide factory .
Years have rolled by but the spectre of terror still remains with the people of Bhopal .
A report from the Indian Council of Medical Research reveals that the sufferings of the afflicted continue unabated .
The pH is an index of hydrogen ion concentration of the liquid .
Water with a pH less than 7 tends to be acidic while water of pH above 7 is alkaline .
The pH range of acid rain - water is between 2 - 5 .
Thus water with pH 4 is more corrosive ( 10 times ) than water with pH 5 .
Water of pH 3 is still more corrosive ( 100 times ) than water having a pH 5 .
If this is the case then one can imagine the corrosive nature of acid rain with a pH ranging between . 2 and 3 .
The lowest pH value recorded for a storm in northeastern United States was 2.1 , during November 1964 .
The lowest ever recorded in Europe was 2.4 , which was reported to be as acidic as vinegar in Pittochry , a Scottish highland town .
Still lower pH value of 1.5 was observed during 1983 at Wheeling in West Virginia , United States .
In India , rainfall with a pH of 4.8 was recorded at Greater Bombay during 1974 - 75 .
The problem in most of our cities is that the old power plants have not yet installed high chimneys and continue to emit sulphur dioxide ; nitrogen oxides remain even more difficult to control , and the problem of acid rain continues to worsen .
What has taken human kind decades to build and Nature millennia to evolve is being impoverished and destroyed in a matter of a few years . "
Harmful Effects of Acid Rain On land , acid rain can , retard the growth of crops and plants , damage forests and pose a potential respiratory health hazard to humans .
In Germany , Switzerland and Sweden , about half of the natural forests are dead or are dying and about 60 per cent of the trees in Britain show signs of decay .
In agriculture these chemicals are used to protect plants against pests and diseases and to treat seeds .
These pesticides , developed during the past three decades only , though being useful to mankind , have led to a plethora of environmental problems .
DDT has saved many lives by killing mosquitoes that carry malaria and other diseases . But , when DDT accumulates in the bodies of fish , birds , and other wildlife , it acts as a pollutant .
To increase agricultural production , a broad spectrum of pesticides was introduced which resulted in the resurgence of pests with more resistance .
Hence , it became inevitable to use excess of pesticides and this in turn led to widespread occurrence of pesticide residues in almost all agricultural products .
The presence of pesticidal residues in vegetables , milk , breast - milk , fish and meat have been detected .
Samples of food and water reveal residue levels far exceeding the maximum permissible limits permitted The most commonly used pesticides are either organo - chlorine compounds or organophosphorous compounds .
Most of them are also soluble in fats . Thus there is a steady increase in the accumulation of these pesticides in the food chain .
Toxic Metals : This category includes metals such as mercury , cadmium , lead , chromium , copper and arsenic , and each will be discussed separately .
Only in very recent years have people woken up to the threat posed by mercury poisoning in the atmosphere .
Natural waters contain only a few parts per billion of mercury .
Mercury enters the biosphere as a waste product during the production of chlorine when mercury is used as an electrode in the electrolysis of brine .
Apart from the oil refineries , plastic and battery manufacturing industries also contribute to mercury pollution .
The dangers of exposure to mercury were reported during the nineteenth century when hat - makers were found developing peculiar symptoms of quiver and slurring of speech which gave rise to the phrase ' mad as a hatter ' .
Due to exposure to large quantities of mercury , hat - makers became susceptible to impairment of the central nervous system .
In the early fifties hundreds of people died of mercury poisoning at Minamata in Japan .
Minamata , a small picturesque town , evinced a disease called by its name ' Minamata disease ' that devoured scores of men and women and children .
The disease , a strange ailment of the people ' s nervous system claimed 400 lives initially during 1950 .
Above the yonder mansion in the west the half moon is dreaming and within my mind I hear the call of a flute from far away . " Again , " Now is the time to set the boat afloat on the waters . Ah me , the weariness of waiting on the bank is intolerable . . . "
At last on 27 May 1912 , Rabindranath sailed for London , accompanied by his son Rathindranath and daughter - in - law , Pratima .
Rothenstein had visited India in 1910 and had come to know the artist - brothers , Abanindranath and Gaganendranath , during his stay in Calcutta .
I felt an immediate attraction , and asked whether I might draw him , for I discovered an inner charm as well as great physical beauty , which I tried to set down with my pencil .
A city ' s water supply usually comes from a distant location , but its sewage enters nearby waterways .
The oxidisable and fermentable components present in sewage cause a depletion of dissolved oxygen in the receiving water .
Deficiency of oxygen leads to the production of a strong stench .
The presence of large quantities of suspended matter causes serious problems because it gets deposited on the river - bed or behind weirs as sludge .
When the suspended matter is of highly organic nature , putrefaction sets in .
As a result , the solid wastes with objectionable odour are buoyed up by gas to float on the water surface .
The pathogenic bacteria cause cholera , typhoid fever and shigella dysentery .
London ' s history provides a classic example .
Sewage turned the river Thames into a mass of filth , with 20,000 people dying in cholera outbreaks in 1849 and 1853 .
During the same period , typhoid epidemics hit many cities in the USA .
Agricultural Pollutants in Water Sewage is not the only source of excess nutrients in surface waters .
Modern techniques employed in agriculture and use of a broad spectrum of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides have contributed much to environmental degradation , especially to water pollution .
Chemical fertilisers are also often washed out of the soil by rain .
They eventually drain into streams and rivers where they nourish the algae as effectively as they would have nourished the farmer ' s crops .
The three major pollutants under this category are fertilisers ; pesticides and farm animal wastes .
In recent years there has been an increased use of fertilisers .
Fertilisers generally contain one or more of the plant nutrientsnitrogen , phosphorous and potassium .
Application of excess fertilisers than what is required is washed and ultimately joins water courses .
Among the fertilisers , nitrates cause undesirable effects on rivers and lakes .
The Sea of Galilee ( Lake Kinneret ) , fed by the river Jordan , provides one - third of water supply of Israel .
Nitrates from the agricultural areas along the Jordan have been flowing into the lake and causing eutrophication .
Same is true of detergent phosphates which pass through the sewage systems to break down to phosphorous .
Eutrophication is the enrichment of nutrient salts and development of a richer and more varied flora .
The process is sometimes referred to as ' algal bloom ' when the predominant aquatic plant is algae .
These excessive growths later decay to produce foul odours , with a resultant increase in the demand for oxygen .
About 50 - 70 per cent of phosphorous flowing into lakes and rivers of the USA each year , comes from the breakdown of detergent phosphates .
Even in Europe , Lake Constance is beset with this problem where a 2,500 per cent increase in phosphorous since 1920 has led to depletion of two - thirds of its oxygen .
Increase in the number of cattle and poultry has also been a cause for water pollution .
The wash - waters from cattle sheds and poultry farms contain phosphates , organic matter , bacteria and other micro - organisms which over the years cause eutrophication .
A typical example is the distillery .
Another major contributor is electroplating wastes which are normally stored inside the factory premises .
Though stored in the premises , the wastes percolate through the soil and heavily contaminate the adjoining wells . The major menace is the discharge of effluents over land .
These obscene conditions are prevalent where tanneries and textile processing units are clustered .
For instance , at Ambur in Tamil Nadu such a sight is very common .
One who travels in that area can see the frothy colourful pools of effluents stagnating on either side of the road and emanating a foul odour .
These pools along with small streams of effluents running over agricultural lands , have rendered unfit more than 1,000 wells which were once the chief sources for agriculture and drinking .
When Tagore arrived in London where he hardly knew any one else , almost the first thing he did was to call up Rothenstein and , knowing his interest in his poems , gave him the notebook in which he had scribbled his translations .
' That evening , " writes Rothenstein , " I read the poems .
Here was poetry of a new order which seemed to me on a level with that of the great mystics .
What Yeats felt about these poems he has himself recorded in the Introduction he wrote for the first limited edition of Gitanjali published by the India Society of London . " I have carried the manuscript of these translations about with me for days , reading it in railway trains , or on the top of omnibuses and in restaurants , and I have often had to close it lest some stranger would see how much it moved me . "
Yeats ' appreciation of the poems encouraged Rothenstein ' to call a few friends at his Hampstead house on the evening of 30 June when Yeats read out the poems to a choice gathering of distinguished writers .
It was here that Tagore first met C . F . Andrews who became his lifelong friend and associate .
Andrews who was at that time a missionary attached to the Cambridge Brotherhood has left his record of that memorable evening : " I walked back along the side of Hampstead Heath with H . W . Nevinson but spoke very little .
I wanted to be alone and think in silence of the wonder and glory of it all .
When I had left Nevinson I went across the Heath . The night was cloudless and there was something of the purple of the Indian atmosphere about the sky .
Reviewing the poems after the publication of Gitanjali , Ezra Pound wrote : " It is a little over a month since I went to Mr Yeats ' rooms and found him much excited over the advent of a great poet , someone ' greater than any of us . '
It is hard to tell where to begin . . . We have found our new Greece , suddenly .
As the sense of balance came back upon Europe in the days before the Renaissance , so it seems to me does this sense of a saner stillness come now to us in the midst of our clangour of mechanisms . . .
And this is in sharp contrast with the western mode , where man must be shown attempting to master nature if we are to have ' great drama ' .
It is in contrast to the Hellenic representation of man , the sport of the gods , and both in the grip of destiny . . . When I leave Mr Tagore I feel exactly as if I were a barbarian clothed in skins , and carrying a stone war - club .
" Briefly , I find in these poems a sort of ultimate common sense , a reminder of one thing and forty things which we are ever likely to lose sight of in the confusion of our Western life , in the racket of our cities , in the jabber of manufactured literature , in the vortex of advertisement .
" If these poems have a flawI do not admit that they have but if they have quality that will put them at a disadvantage with the ' general reader , ' it is that they are too pious .
Yet I have nothing but pity for the reader who is unable to see that their piety is the poetic piety of Dante , and that it is very beautiful . "
Tagore , however , was not in England when Gitanjali was published .
Though his stay in England during this visit was not long a little over four months it was very hectic and fruitful , thanks to Rothenstein and the warm affection he received from his other British acquaintances and friends .
Among other celebrities , he met Bernard Shaw , H . G . Wells , Bertrand Russell , John Galsworthy , Robert Bridges , John Masefield , Sturge Moore , W . H . Hudson and Stopford Brooke .
He himself was much struck by " the breadth of view and the rapidity of thought that he found among his new friends , " and said , " Those who know the English only in India do not know Englishmen . "
Rothenstein proposed to the India Society that they should print for its members a selection of Tagore ' s poems for which Yeats agreed to write an Introduction .
It was thus that Gitanjali was first published in English in a limited edition of 750 copies before Macmillans of London brought out a popular edition .
Traffic noise , blaring horns , loudspeakers that shatter the air , and film songs or even religious songs and discourses cause needless noise pollution in a city .
Three major sources of noise pollution are :
Transportation ( surface and air traffic ) .
Community activities ( entertainment , construction works , etc . ) .
Industrial noise , particularly from mechanical saws and pneumatic drills , can become unbearable and prove a nuisance to the public .
The main menace of noise is the transport system .
A recent aspect of aeroplane noise is the sonic boom .
It causes significant damage to property besides giving a fright to humans and animals .
According to Kryter ( 1970 ) , noise causes heart output to decrease with fluctuations in arterial blood pressure and vaso - constriction of peripheral blood vessels .
Mention must be made about ' startle reaction ' in which a sudden and high intensity pulse of sound affects the nervous system and the psycho - motor performance .
Even our optical system is not spared .
Pupillary dilation , impairment of night vision and decrease in the rate of colour perception are some of the adverse effects of noise .
Noise affects sleep and work performance , especially of watch - repairers and others where precision is called for .
For example , noise from a fan can be reduced by increasing the number of blades or by decreasing the rotational speed without reduction in the air flow .
It is high time we took stock of the situation to act in a manner that would make life more liveable on this planet for our future generations .
Obviously man wants to survive and to do that he must have ' breathable air and drinkable water ' .
He must have clear blue skies and clean streams and unspoilt forests .
Environment is the priceless gift of Nature .
Protection of environment and maintenance of ecological balance is our prime duty .
We must keep the earth lush green so that we all can live together in an environment free from pollution .
We have to protect our environment to protect ourselves .
Otherwise the day is not far when man himself may become an endangered species !
As far as an uninitiated person can , guess from a translation , that does not seem to be an exaggeration .
It is certain , however , that no poet in Europe since the death of Goethe in 1832 can rival Tagore in noble humanity , in unaffected greatness , in classical tranquillity . "
No two regions could be more different from one another than the tropical lowlands of Bengal and the snow - capped highlands of Scandinavia , in physical climate and social environments .
No less profound was the impression made by these poems on a young and unknown lad of fifteen in the even more remote region of Iceland , who was to win much later a Nobel Prize for himselfthe distinguished novelist , Halldor Laxness . Recalling this impression he writes , " This strange , distant and subtle voice at once found its way to the very depths of my youthful spiritual ear ; and ever since , at given moments , I feel its presence in the innermost labyrinths of my mind , . .
What an enviable god , this god of Tagore : the Great Friend , the Beloved , the Lotos flower , the unknown man playing a lute in the boat yonder on the river ! . . .
Nowadays our god in the west is either the director of the Big All World Firm Inc . , or the primitive imaginary playmate of the childish mind .
He is the one we cry to in the hours of precipitate danger and in the hour of our death .
This is why a spiritual reality like Tagore ' s probably shall remain only one more eastern wonder to the western mind yet for a long long time to come . "
THIS long sojourn in the West helped to broaden Tagore ' s sympathies which were already broad enough , and deepened his understanding of the intellectual and spiritual urges that have spurred the western mind to great achievement .
The six days that Gandhi spent in Santiniketan during this visit laid the foundation of a lifelong friendship between him and Tagore , two makers of modern India , and brought into relief the obvious contrasts as well as the veiled kinship between their personalities and the dynamics of their idealism .
Beneath the mask of what seemed contrary was a kinship so deep and subtle that only they themeselves were aware of it , barring a few common friends and admirers of exceptional sensibility , like an Andrews or a Jawaharlal Nehru .
The so - called disciples or " devout followers " of both saw mostly the grimace in the mask and not eh smile concealed behind it .
In his characteristic , matter - of - fact and practical manner , Gandhi looked around , made friends with all , put his finger on the weak spots and taught the inmates of the asrma how to implement their own ideals better .
He told them that they must do wholly without hired labour and take upon themselves the responsibility of keeping the asrama clean , as they kept their own bodies , clean , and of running all its services including the cooking of food , washing dishes , etc .
The young are always drawn to new adventures and both the pupils and the teachers warmly welcomed Gandhi ' s advice .
When Tagore was told of it , he smiled and said that the experiment contained the key to Swaraj .
And so on 10 March 1915 the experiment was launched .
On the following day Gandhi left for Rangoon .
That the experiment did not last very long surprised neither Gandhi nor Tagore .
Tagore knew that whatever he did would seem wrong in die eyes of some of his countrymen , that he would never cease to be maligned for his radicalism and reviled for his conservatism .
He knew it and yet was hurt by public criticism .
He would not learn the politician ' s art of wooing die public and yet felt sorry that he could not win die hearts of his people who never forgave him for not sharing their superstitions , the biggest of which was the patriotic delusion that diey were God ' s chosen people .
However brave the reflections in his writings on the vanity of fame or popular goodwill , Tagore was in fact vulnerable to unjust criticism , and often die criticism was unjust , if not malicious .
I had been suffering for a time from deep depression and weariness .
But 1 am sane and sound again , and willing , to live another hundred years , if critics would spare me .
At that time I was physically tired ; therefore the least hurt assumed a proportion that , was perfectly absurd .
However , I am glad that there is still that child in me who has its weakness for the sweets of human approbation .
I must not feel myself too far above my critics .
After his address to the Academy the Archbishop of Upsala said , " The Nobel Prize for literature is intended for the writer who combines in himself the artist and the prophet .
None has fulfilled these conditions better than Rabindranath Tagore . "
The strain , physical and emotional , of the German tour affected his health and he longed to return to India to the quite of Santiniketan .
Later , as the acquaintance ripened , his admiration of Tagore knew no bounds .
" Rabindranath Tagore is the greatest man I have had the privilege to know , " he wrote in 1930 .
" He is very much greater than his world reputation and his position in India imply .
He was deeply impressed , not only with the warm affection with which the common citizens welcomed him but with their genuine interest in philosophical and metaphysical problems .
From Germany Tagore went to Vienna to give two lectures and then to Prague where his visit led to a warm personal friendship with the eminent indolgists , M . WWinternitz and V . Lesny , both of whom were later invited by him as Visiting Professors at Visva - Bharati .
Prof . Lesny was the first foreign scholar to translate Tagore ' s writings from the original Bengali , He also wrote a biography of the poet which was later translated and published in English .
Because of these contacts and friendships Tagore retained a very warm affection for Czechoslovakia .
But though the visit was stimulating , he was tired and homesick and returned to India in July 1921 , after an absence of nearly fourteen months .
If he imagined that he was returning to peace and quiet , he was soon to be disillusioned .
The play opens with die King and citizens of Uttarakut preparing to participate in a festival in honour of the Machinevery proud of their achievement and heedless of its consequences to die poor people whose lands would be deprived of water .
The Crown Prince , however , professes open sympadiy with die subject people and rebels against die callousness of his own country .
His character provides the main psychological interest of the play , his love of freedom and justice involving him in a conflict of loyalties .
He succeeds .
The socio - political motif of the play , such there is , seems to dissolve at the end in an undefined sense of mystic exaltation , as in some of Ibsen ' s later plays .
The author has reintroduced in the play that remarkable character , the Ascetic Dhananjaya , prototype of Mahatma Gandhi , who first appeared in his drama Prayaschitta ( Atonement ) , published in 1909 .
In that play as in the present one , Dhananjaya exhorts the subject people to resist the ruler ' s unjust claims - nonviolently and fearlessly .
He risked unpopularity at home and suffered ridicule and jeers for his faith in One World long before that faith became a world - fashion .
A greater sacrifice was the risk he took in exposing his creative leisure and spiritual poise to the clamour of the market place .
Would the glare of limelight help to blossom or to wither the sensitive plant so far nurtured in the protective shade of comparative obscurity ?
The poet was losing to the prophet , the singer to the preacher , the devotee to the missionary .
The " endless meaning in the narrow span of a song " was dissolving in the endless preaching over the wide span of the world .
He was sensitive and sincere enough to be now and then haunted by an awareness of this predicament , as is evident in the following passage ( which reads almost like a confession ) from a letter to Andrews written from Chicago ( 26 February 1921 ) :
" When I came to this world I had nothing but a reed given to me , which was to find its only value in producing music .
I left my school , I neglected my work , but I had my reed and I played on it ' in mere idle sport . '
All along I had one playmate , who also in His play produced music , among leaves , in rushing water , in silence of stars , in tears and laughter rippling into lights and shadows in the stream of human life .
He was personal , reminiscent and friendly , and though he was as usual blunt and forthright in his opposition to war , national rivalries and the fetish of indiscriminate worship of material progress , he soon disarmed hostile criticism and won over many a progressive intellectual .
Tagore returned to India in the latter half of July via Japan where he stayed for about six weeks and gave several lectures .
His visit to China and Japan led to the first conscious attempt in the history of Asia to formulate the idea of Asian Unity by the organisation of an Asiatic Association in Shanghai in September of the same year .
Reporting thiseventthe Christian Science Monitor of Boston wrote : " There is on foot an important movement to establish Asiatic concord through the common culture of Asiatic nations . . . It has been stimulated by the recent visit to the Far East of Rabindranath Tagore , who preached the doctrine of idealism opposed to western materialism .
The new feeling is shown in the formation of Asiatic Associations in the principal centres , thefirst of which is located in Shanghai . . . Inspiration for the movement is acknowledged to Tagore whose teachings permeate the issued declarations . "
Surprisingly enough , no mention was made of Tagore at this latter conference held in his own land .
Politicians have short memories .
Hardly two months at home , then again to the other side of the world .
The occasion was an invitation from the Republic of Peru to attend the centenary celebrations of her attainment of independence .
Amused , the lovely one smiled , " Come , let ' s exchange !
Take my flowers for your fruit of pain rich with tears ! "
I looked at her and knew that she was ruthless in her beauty .
Lightly she picked up my load of fruit and clapped her hands and laughed .
Her abundance of flowers I held to my heart .
The sun climbed to the mid - sky and the heat was great .
Sixteen years later , shortly before his death , the memory was still fresh and the poet , now aged and ailing and waiting for the end , enshrined it in one of his last poems ( Sesh Lekha ) :
How I wish I could once again find my way to that foreign land where waits for me the message of love !
The dreams of yesterday will wing their way back and fluttering softly build their nest a new ,
The death of this gifted brother who had been his friend and guide during the critical years of adolescence , moved him deeply , though he kept his feelings to himself .
He had suffered so many bereavements that death had ceased to be a stranger .
Tagore received him , as usual , with great cordiality and respect , and when he led him to his room which had been tastefully decorated with fresh leaves and flowers , the Mahatma smiled and asked , " Why bring me to this bridal chamber ? "
Gandhi ' s visit both failed and succeeded in its purpose .
If he had hoped to convince Tagore that the charkha was or could ever be anything more than one of the many necessary crafts in an undeveloped village economy , he must have disappointed .
On the other hand , each such meeting and exchange of views , even if only a conflict of views , forged a deeper bond between the two . Whatever the seeming clash between their temperaments and their outlooks , their spirits always met as in a " bridal chamber " .
Tagore wrote a personal letter assuring him that " even if you have hit me hard in the cause of what you think is Truth , our personal relationship based upon mutual respect will bear the strain . "
There was a deep - rooted prejudice in the Indian society , whether Hindu or Muslim , against the public appearance of women on the stage .
With the staging of this play in Calcutta in January 1927 , Tagore made a bold assault on this prejudice by recruiting the entire cast from among girl students of his own university and ladies of good families , all of whom he himself trained and rehearsed .
PARTLY flattered by Mussolini ' s courtship and partly curious to see for himself this colourful personality and its impact on an ancient and lively culture , Tagore accepted an invitation from Italy and sailed for Naples on 15 May 1926 .
As he himself put it , " It is for me to study and not criticise from outside .
I am glad of this opportunity to see for myself the work of one who is assuredly a great man and a movement that will certainly be remembered in history . "
That Fascism will be remembered in history , there is little doubt .
That the Duce was " a great man " was an illusion which Tagore temporarily shared with many shrewd and seasoned politicians of the time .
On arrival in Naples he was received by the chief officials of the city with a message of welcome from Mussolini .
On 7 June the Governor of Rome held a public reception in the capital where he conveyed to the poet the greetings of the Eternal City .
The German tour was once again hectic and he received large ovations everywhere and was received by President Hindenburg .
The linden tree he was made to plant in the park attached to the sanatorium is still cherished as a relic of his visit .
But he could not stay for long and had soon to resume his tour .
After crowded receptions and lecture engagements in Belgrade , Sofia , Bucharest and Athens where the Greek Government decorated him with the " Order of the Redeemer , " he visited Cairo .
The Egyptian Parliament , then in session , was adjourned in his honour and King Fuad presented him with a set of Arabic books for Visva - Bharati .
One would imagine that after this long and hectic tour during which his health had broken down more than once , the poet would have been content to enjoy the seclusion and peace of Santiniketan for which he had longed so much .
Peace and glory are rarely found together and when they meet , they soon part company .
In Java he met , among others , the late President Soekarno , then a compartively unknown revolutionary youth .
His visit was fruitful in restoring a cultural link that had been snapped for ' centuries and attracted many Indonesian students to Visva - Bharati University and led to the adaptation by Santiniketan artists of the Indonesian technique of batik designing and dyeing which has since spread to many parts of India .
After a short visit to Thailand where he delivered a lecture on Education at the University in Bangkok , he returned to India in December , in time to preside over the annual celebrations at Santiniketan .
Once again he prepared to leave for abroad on receipt of an invitation from Oxford University to deliver the Hibbert Lectures , but the voyage had to be abandoned as he fell ill on arrival in Madras .
After a week ' s rest at Adyar as the guest of Annie Besant and a few more days in the pleasant climate of Coonoor , he sailed for Ceylon hoping to recoup his health sufficiently to take a boat from there to England .
On the way he landed at Pondicherry to visit Sri Aurobindo Ghosh whom he had known in his earlier days of revolutionary political activity .
Today I saw him seated in the poise of calm wisdom , and I repeated in silence , Aurobindo , accept the salutation of Rabindra . "
He stayed in Colombo for ten days , but as there was no visible improvement in health , he gave up all hope of sailing for England and returned to the mainland , resting for three weeks in Bangalore as the guest of his old friend , the learned philosopher Sir Brajendranath Seal , Vice - Chancellor of the Mysore University .
Then came the blow .
I shivered and asked in fear : What more ?
Is the final thunderbolt yet to fall ?
It fell Could this be all ?
Nothing more ?
My fear fell from me .
When your thunderbolt loomed above , you seemed so much bigger than I . When you came down to strike me , you shrunk to my level and I ceased to shrink .
Big you may be , but not bigger than death .
It ' s I who am now bigger than death .
Let this be my last word . "
Whatever the affliction and Rabindranath had his full share he never succumbed to morbidity which he considered as a disease of the mind worse than any disease of the body .
Sorrow and defeat were part of life and must be accepted with manly dignity .
The cult of growling when balked or of whining like a beaten cur in which some poets have vented their pride or sought their solace was repugnant to his nature .
Such sentimentalism as he sometime indulged in was provoked by his pity for others , pity for life , but rarely by self - pity .
His most dominant feeling was his love of life , his philosophy was but an affirmation of it .
The joy of living and exercising his sensibilities was to him a gift divinely dispensed for which he never ceased to be grateful .
The night has waned and the world ' s petals unfold .
On the bark of this noble tree are inscribed The music of this wheel revolving and rolling onward , invisibly , inaudibly , had never ceased to fascinate him .
He looks back on the past , and there she stands , his beloved Muse , the ever varied , ever - beckoning Guardian Angel of his life .
Must he still keep on pouring himself out and be emptied completely ?
This and many other poems , some reminiscent , some pensive , some exultant , including the angry one named " A Question " , referred to above , written on a variety of subjects and instinct with mellowed wisdom that come from conquered sorrow , were published as Parisesh ( The End ) in 1932 .
As the title indicates , he thought that they marked the end of his creative career .
But in fact they marked only the end of a phase which had begun eighteen years earlier , in 1914 , with , Balaka .
It was a majestic phase which had begun and ended splendidly .
Another phase was to begin of which he had a premonition in the poem cited above where he saw his Muse , the smiling lady half - veiled , waiting with an empty basket in her hand .
As though the ageing poet had suddenly recovered his prime of life , he was seized with passion to explore new ground , to strike music out of prose , to exploit the rhythmic possibilities of this pedestrain , utilitarian medium .
However hardy rugged and uneven the ground , he would make his Muse trip over it as gracefully and with - as much abandon as over the loveliest meadow .
This he did superbly in the four volumes : Punascha ( Postscript , 1932 ) , Sesh Saptak ( Last Melodies , 1935 ) , Patraput ( Plate of Leaves , 1936 ) , and Syamali ( The Dark Green One , 1936 ) .
The urge to preach and to reform the world was also cooling down .
" The preacher is the professional dealer in particular ideas , " he had once written . " His customers come at all hours of the day and put questions to him .
His answers , which he gets into the habit of producing , gradually lose their living quality and his faith in his ideas runs the risk of being smothered under the deadness of his words .
I believe that such a tragedy is more common than people suspect , especially with those who are good and therefore are ever ready to sign their cheque of benefit for others without waiting to see if the cash has had time to accumulate in the bank .
This makes me think that it is safe to be nothing better than a mere poet . For poets have to be true to their best moments and not to other people ' s requirements . "
Such golden moments were waiting for him to gather and it was lucky for him and his readers that he was henceforth to be confined to his home soil and thrown back on his native resources .
You have been to me a true friend because you have been a candid friend often speaking your thoughts aloud . . .
If your heart approves of the action I want your blessing .
It will sustain me . "
But even before the letter was despatched he received the poet ' s wire : " It is well worth sacrificing precious life for the sake of India ' s unity and her social integrity .
Our sorrowing hearts will follow your sublime penance with reverence and love . "
On 24 September , Tagore , unable to keep away , left for Poona . to visit the Mahalma in Yeravdajail .
The British Govern - , ment having in the meanwhile conceded the main demand and accepted the compromise formula , the Mahatma broke his fast on the 26th , the poet seated by his bedside in jail .
" The fast taken in the name of God , " said the Mahatma in a public statement , " was broken in His name in the presence of Gurudev . . .
The hymn sung was the original of the Gitanjali poem : " When the heart is hard and parched up , come upon me with a shower of mercy . . . "
Tagore had been persuaded by the University of Calcutta to accept the Chair of Bengali , in which capacity he now delivered a series of lectures .
He also organised a project , under his direct personal supervision , for compiling a glossary of technical and scientific terms in Bengali , a subject in which he had shown interest more than half a century ago when he was in his youth .
In the midst of many public activities which included several important lectures , he wrote two new plays , Tosher Desk ( The Kingdom of Cards ) , a delightful satire based on an earlier short story , and Chandalika ( The Untouchable Girl ) , a short drama with only two characters on the stage , based on a Buddhist legend .
The naive plot of the popular legend , showing how the psychic power of the Buddha had saved his devotee from the lust of a chandal girl , has been transformed by Tagore into a psychological drama of great spiritual significance .
It is no longer the story of a wanton female bent on seducing a holy man , but of a very sensitive and proud girl , condemned by birth to adespised status , who is suddenly awakened to a consciousness of her destiny as a human being as good as any other , and to an awareness of her heart ' s hunger and capacity for love .
Both these plays , Tasher Desk and Chandalika , were staged in Calcutta in September .
Soon after the performances , which were followed by a lecture on Chhanda ( Prosody ) at the Calcutta University , Tagore left for Bombay with a party of Santiniketan students and artists to participate in a Tagore Week organised there by his admirers led by the poetess Sarqjini Naidu .
The lectures delivered at the Andhra University were later published as Man .
After a visit to Hyderabad where he was received by the Nizam who had earlier given a handsome donation to Visva - Bharati for a Chair of Islamic Studies , Tagore returned to Calcutta at the end of December to deliver his famous address at the Senate Hall on " Bharat - Pathik Rammohun " ( Rammohun the Indian Pilgrim . )
Seeing another woman , younger and healthy , take her place by her husband ' s side in the garden , Niraja assumed the worst and was wild with jealousy .
Her very suspicions , which she took no care to hide , provoked fate and brought about what she most feared .
She who was generous when happy became unjust and vindictive .
Deprived of health and then of love , she succumbed to the poverty of spirit which paralyses our capacity to love and to forgive .
Bansari is a witty play , sparkling with brilliant dialogue .
It depicts the sophistication of high society in Calcutta , their highbrow pretensions and snobberies .
The capacity for love is dissipated in intellectual flirtations resulting in a tragedy presented as a comedy . The play was never staged by the author , though he once planned its productionprobably because the author was not sure of its effectiveness on the stage .
His own acquaintance with the life and types of characters he was depicting was remote , largely - derived from hearsay and gossip .
His treatment of love was becoming more and more intellectualised , bolder in thought but less potent in conveying its feeling .
Not only the flesh and blood but perhaps the heart , too was getting old , only the mind was active and in full armour .
Returning to Santiniketan at the beginning of January 1934 , he received , a fortnight later , Jawaharlal Nehru and his wife , Kamala .
The poet who admired jawaharlal Nehru for his patriotic courage and intellectual integrity , his rational outlook and international sympathies , held a public reception to welcome him and his wife .
Meanwhile on 15 January , north India was rocked by an earthquake of great severity , causing great damage to life and property in several towns of Bihar .
Gandhi who was at that time touring south India said in a public statement that this calamity was a divine chastisement for the sin of untouchability .
" A man like me cannot but believe that this earthquake is a divine chastisement sent by God for our sins . .
For me there is a vital connection between the Bihai calamity and the untouchability campaign . "
Tagore was shocked to see the Mahatma resort to such a characteristically priestly tactic of exploiting the conception of sin to din fear in the minds of the people and said in a public statement : " It has caused me a painful surprise to find Mahatma Gandhi accusing those who blindly follow their own social custom of untouchability of having brought down God ' s vengeance upon certain parts of Bihar , evidently specially selected for His desolating displeasure . .
The university which was his pet child had become a prodigal , a source of constant headache and humiliation to the last years of a life otherwise free and glorious .
Begging was a humiliation to this aristocratic mind ; nor was it of much avail in a country where the moneyed classes pour offerings either in the lap of priests or in the pockets of politicians . The only way left to the ageing poet was to earn money by making the school itself productive .
This he could do by training troupes of actors and dancers who would stage his plays and ballets in different towns and help to raise money .
This was not , of course , the only reason .
The artist in him itched to see his own creations on the stage .
Unlike his other written works , the songs had to be sung to be enjoyed , the ballets staged to be appreciated .
And so the country was regaled with the unusual spectacle of the venerable poet and seer escorting a band of performing artists , singers and dancers all over the country .
The two novels Malancha and CharAdhyay ( both 1934 ) , the drama Bansari ( 1933 ) and two books of verse Parisesh ( 1932 ) and Vichitrita ( 1933 ) have already been referred to earlier .
Of the five remaining volumes of poetry , four were of prose - poems , a form in which he had occasionally experimented earlier but which he now took up in earnest .
He began it with Punsacha ( The Postscript ) , published soon after Pariseshin 1932 .
There is a large variety of themes and moods depicted in this and the three volumes of prose - poems which followed , some playful , some serious or even metaphysical , some frivolous , some sad , some narrative , some lyrical , some sentimental and some devastating in their irony .
Many of them are reminiscent and some in the first person singular , though what is in first person singular need not always be reminiscent or autobiographical .
Once he had to face the challenge of a celebrated Pandit from the south .
Noticing that the turban he proposed to wear at the contest was soiled , he took it to jaseem the local dyer .
Jaseem asked his young daughter Amina to take the turban to the near - by stream and wash it .
Having washed it . when the cloth was spread on the grass to dry , Amina noticed averse inscribed in one corner of it : Tomdr sripada mor Idldte biraje ( Your sacred feet rest on my forehead ) .
Amina fetched from her cottage some coloured thread and stitched another verse below it : Parash phi ne tat hridayer majhe ( That ' s why their touch is missing in the heart ) .
When the Pandit came to fetch his turban he noticed the second verse and stared at the dyer ' s daughter .
Then he said , " Maiden , you have transformed the arrogance of my intellect into wisdom of the heart .
I cannot now go back to the royal court .
My way lies elsewhere . "
- Even after adding the Postscript he found he had much to say , he needed to think and feel aloud at any rate on paper .
The very first poem is full of regrets that he failed to appraise her worth ( Whose ? his wife Mrinalini ' s ? ) when she was with him .
He took her love and devotion for granted .
On his birthday ( 25 Vaisakh by Bengali calendar ) he reviews his long life during which he has died and has been reborn again and again , a garland woven of many Rabindranaths , He looks back on the world ' s past and sees nothing but broken ruins of pomp and glory and pride .
All around are the shifting sands of imperma - nence , and in the midst of itall " I feel in the throbbing of my heart the stillness of the infinite . "
Suddenly there was a rustle and he could feel her presence arid almost a touch of her breath , " Have you come back to your old haunt from the other world ? "
He replied , " Why , am I not there ?
Can you not see me ? "
Our school was rushing forward madly , with arithmetic and grammar books running fast .
The maps were fluttering on the wall like birds flapping their wings .
The bells tolled ceaselessly and without break , with no heed of the hour .
If she prefers Delhi , Lahore or Agra all we need do is to put a turban on her head and horned shoes on her feet .
Or if she wished to rush off to England , all the people will become hatted coated and booted Englishmen ! "
Three volumes of serious verse followed in the wake of Senjuti discussed earlier : Akashpradip ( Lamp in the Sky ) . 1939 , Navajatak ( The New - Born ) 1940 and Sanai ( The Flute ) 1940 .
These poems lack the sombre grandeur of Prantik , for the memory of the Borderland and the haunting sense of the terror and beauty that Meanwhile he was content to relax and watch and savour what simple delight of sight and sound were still left for him on earth .
Unlike many of his characters in dramas and novels who are either mere types or his own ' mouth pieces , die characters in his short stories are real and vivid , some of them unforgettable .
He wrote in one of his letters : " If I do nothing else but write short stories I am happy and I make a few readers happy .
The main cause of happiness is that my characters become my companions , they are with me when I am shut up in my room on a rainy day , and on a sunny day they walk about with me on the bright banks of the Padma .
Today since early morning a petulant little girl named Giribala has entered my imaginary world . "
Giribala lives in Bengali literature as one of the most lovable specimens of Indian womanhood .
Pity and irony pervade the mood of these stories , pity for wasted youth and frustrated ideals , for the bud that withers before it blossomed , and irony at man ' s egoism and at the inhumanity of a social and religious order which debase the living to exalt the dead .
Some of diem are , ironically , die protagonists of the very system which has diwarted their lives and warped their minds ; some are nagging and cantankerous and drive husbands to despair ; some prefer their jewellery to their husbands ' love .
One of his most romantic heroines is a Muslim princess who gives up everything for the sake of the Hindu general whom she admires and loves .
She chided , " Youdon ' thave to do this . " He remained silent . But in the end he won her friendship .
A gold ring she gave him one day with something sweet inscribed on it .
While bathing in the Ganges it slipped from his finger and was lost .
" The lock is not there , and the key does no fit . "
He recalls the nursery rhyme his grandmother used to recite to him : " The bride comes in the palanquin , with strings of pearls round her neck and anklets of gold round her feet ! " Ever since then he had looked for that bride who , on her way to him , was lost among the stars . .
The next volume of poems , Navajatak ( The New - Born ) , express a very different mood , more masculine and vitally concerned with what was happening around him in the contemporary world .
Introducing these poems he wrote that his poetry had changed its season from time to time , often without his being aware of it .
These poems were his tete - a - tete with the new age that was taking birth all around him .
It needs to be pointed out that these various volumes were not written as separate bunches , each at a stretch and representing a uniform mood or phase .
Many poems published in separate volumes were actually written almost simultaneously .
The very first poem , for example , of Navajatak in which he hails the new age was written in August 1938 , though the volume was published in 1940 .
His transition from mood to mood , even from whim to whim , was often very swift and sometimes occurred many times in one day .
These varying moods were expressed in widely differing poems which were later sorted out and published in different volumes .
The poems of Navajatak are comparatively less subjective in mood and reflect his keen interest in the world around .
The very themes and metaphors employed indicate this objective concern : the radio , the railway train , the station , the aeroplane , Hindustan , Rajasthan . etc .
The poem referred to earlier , mocking the Japanese militarists praying to Buddha , the Compassionate , is from this collection and was written in January 1938 .
The climate of menace and aggression in Europe and in Far East and the misuse of the aeroplane as an engine of destruction has biased him against this invention of man .
In the poem entitled " Bird - Man " he laments that this evil emissary of aggression should have invaded the space which God had reserved for birds .
The death of this devoted friend was a deeply felt personal bereavement to the poet .
Earlier he had said that he could not harbour an ill - feeling against the British people , if for no other reasoiithan that Andrews was one of them .
There was a time when Andrews was very close to him and was one of his chief associates , advisers and friends . To no one else did Tagore ever write so many letters in English , full of such open - hearted confidences , as though he had needed a trustworthy friend to whom he could think and feel aloud .
Christ ' s Faithful Apostle , was how an Indian admirer had interpreted the initials of his name , C . F . A . Being what he was , his presence was needed in many places , in India and outside , far away from Santiniketan and Tagore ' s presence .
And so the active contacts between the two had of late diminished , though the old bond had survived .
Tagore could be exuberant , and sometimes even loquacious , in his literary expression , but in personal relations he was very reticent and seemed , not unoften , aloof and remote , even when his heart was full of affection .
And so , although he must have felt deeply the loss of so old and trusted a friend , he kept the grief to himself except for the homage he paid to his memory at the memorial service at Santiniketan .
' A few days later , when he was at Mungpoo , he recalled to his hostess how Andrews , whenever he was at Santiniketan , would come in the morning and embrace him daily , and went on - to add : " What an unmixed wonderful love he had !
The observance of his birthday in that little mountainous village had a simple and austere dignity which could hardly have been possible in a bigger place like Kalimpong , much less in a city like Calcutta .
In Mungpoo there were no social and literary celebrities to crowd round him , obscuring the sad solemnity of his last but one birthday on this earth .
He sat on the ground , burnt an incense and chanted an invocation to the Buddha .
The poet was moved and expressed his feeling in a poem he wrote the next day .
Listening to the hymn addressed to " the supreme man whose birth made this earth holy and gave meaning to man ' s life , " he felt that his own birth had been blessed , for ' entering the world of men eighty years ago , I too have shared the supreme man ' s legacy . "
They brought flowers , heaps of them , for the poet .
This simple gesture of affection from humble , illiterate folks who had never read anything of him , touched him deeply .
True - hearted and brave , the final frustration of her hope ( the title of the story , " Durasha " , means Frustrated Hope ) is depicted with masterly irony .
Even more romantic is the story of the Moghul Princess Amiina who is ready to avenge her father ' s death , only to discover that the Prince of Arakon in whose breast she was supposed to plunge her dagger is the very beloved vagabond Dalia in disguise with whom she had been in love .
Some stories deal with man ' s lust for gold , some with woman ' s relentless goading of husband or son to ambition , some with the tragedy of decrepit aristocracy clinging to the illusion of glory long faded , some depict uncommon types like a gifted vagabond whom no lure of riches or comfort or love can bind to a home , or an unruly tomboy who grows into a wonderfully mature and loving woman .
One of these relates the story of the skeleton which used to hang in the class - room of the child Rabi for lessons in elementary science .
Some stories lay bare the political helplessness of the people and the callous cynicism of the alien rulers , like the beautiful story in which the charming Giribala , referred to above , figures .
In a delightful story a satirical phantasy which he much later in 1933 developed into a play called Tosher Desk ( The Kingdom of Cards ) , he relates the experiences of the traditional adventurers of Indian folklore , the Prince and his two boon companions , who are ship wrecked and stranded on a strange island whose inhabitants are all classified and labelled like a pack of cards .
One is Five , another Six , another Jack or Queen ; one is Diamonds , another Hearts , another Spades and so on .
They sit , rise , fight and make love in strict accordance with a prescribed set of rules which no one understands but every one obeys .
We laugh at the Fives and Sixes without realising that we are laughing at our own absurdities .
And yet in the same year was published Chhele Beta , reminiscences of his boyhood days , written in a style simple , lively and unaffected , and utterly different from the manner and mood reflected in the three stories cited above .
Tagore thought and felt and reacted creatively at different levels , almost simultaneously , as though he could control many wave - lengths and could switch off one and switch on another at will .
Perhaps not quite at will , for he was himself subject to the mood that happened to seize him at the moment .
There was an old and discarded palanquin lying in one of the rooms of the family mansion which had belonged to his grandmother , and in which the child Rabi sought refuge in the afternoon when the servant in charge of him had retired for his own meals and rest .
Between the discarded palanquin and the neglected child there was a secret fellow - feeling and comradeship .
The child would sprawl within its closed shutters safe from all prying eyes and give full rein to his fancy .
Sometimes my palanquin becomes a peacock - boat , floating far out on the ocean till the shore is out of sight .
The oars fall into the water with a gentle splash , the waves swing and swell around us .
The sailors cry out to us to beware , a storm is coming .
By the tiller stands Abdul the sailor , with his pointed beard , shaven moustache and close - cropped head . I know him , he brings hilsha fish and turtle eggs from the Paclma for my elder brother . "
Three days after the Oxford University ' s special Convocation on 7 August ( a significant date on which eight years earlier his grandson Nitindra had died in Germany and on which he himself would pass away a year later ) Tagore gave a public address on the cultural significance of the Ramayana and paid a tribute to the memory of the great poet Tulsidas whose Hindi rendering of the Indian epic has been called the Bible of the Hindi - speaking world .
On 3 September he presided over the Festival of Rain at Santiniketanfor the last time .
A fortnight later he was in Calcutta for a medical check - up , and on 19 September went up to Kalimpong to recuperate in the glorious autumn of the eastern Himalayas .
The sky claps its hands in silent glee , my joy is full with colour and sound , Is Kalimpong aware of it ? . . .
The golden bell of morning rings ding dong ,
This was written on 25 September .
Once again " with stealthy steps the messenger of death came creeping out of the lightless cavern of the universe . "
As during the previous crisis , no adequate medical help was readily available , and Kalimpong was even farther from Calcutta than Santiniketan .
He has himself related how once , many years earlier , when he had occasion to sleep alone in an unused ground - floor room of their old ancestral house in Calcutta , he was woken up at dead of night by an excruciatingly sharp pain in one of the toes which had been stung by a large scorpion of a vicious kind .
Few experiences are more immediately painful than a scorpion sting .
This strange experience of an abrupt and total cessation of acute pain by an effort of will was never repeated , but whenever he was again in any physical pain or discomfort he always recalled his earlier experience and tried his utmost to disembody his consciousness .
And when the spring came in early February , he had almost recovered his old robustness and could rejoice in the glory of nature and the joy of life , and was once again deeply concerned with the world of men .
In one such mood he dictated a remarkable poem on 13 February in which " floating oil Time ' s leisurely stream , " he casts his mind back on the panorama of his people ' s history .
This poem , as also the one discussed earlier where he talked of empires falling and the toilers sustaining the world , does in noway indicate that the aged poet , face to face with death , had suddenly changed his faith and turned a " fellow - traveller " .
Along with ser jous verse , he was also dictating nursery rhymes as well as tales and fables told as grandfatherly yarns and prattle full of such gay fancy and quaint humour that one would hardly imagine that they were the voice of one who was in extreme physical pain and almost on death - bed .
The latterwere published in 1941 as Galpa - Salpa ( Tales and Trifles ) .
And that is the big news , that the world is in need of a drastic adjustment .
It is told to little Kusmi by her Dadamashai ( Grandfather ) whom she is always asking , " What ' s the big news today ? "
But Kusmi can make This book of parables and tales as well as the volume of poems Janmadine discussed earlier were published in April 1941 .
The Bengali new year begins in the middle of this month and its celebration at Santiniketan used to be ( and still is ) combined with the observance of Tagore ' s birthday ( which actually falls about three weeks later , on 7 May ) , to enable the students to participate in the joint festival before they dispersed for the summer holidays which began soon after .
On that day ( 14 April 1941 ) was delivered the poet ' s last public address , published as Sabhyatar Sankat ( Crisis in Civilisation ) .
" As I look around I see the crumbling ruins of a proud civilisation strewn like a vast heap of ftitility .
And yet I shall . not commit the grievous sin of losing faith in Man .
I would rather look forward to the opening of a new chapter in his history after the cataclysm is over and the atmosphere rendered clean with the spirit of service and sacrifice . "
How genuine was his faith in the destiny of Man ( whether ill - or well - founded , who can tell ? ) is even more fervently expressed in a new song composed by him and sung for the first time on the same occasion .
A few days earlier his grand - nephew Saumyendranath Tagore had come from Calcutta to see him and had begged him to give a new song which could be sung in chorus to hail the advent of the new man , the real man , the free man who will vindicate man ' s true destiny and not be a mere cog in a social or political machine .
The Great One comes , on earth the blades of grass shiver in anticipation , in the heavens the trumpets sound . . .
His own physical suffering , the burden of a body tormented with pain , with little or no respite ' .
His unhappy country becoming like a vast prison camp , the leaders in jail , the people cowed and sullen , the spectre of hunger stalking the land .
The daily toll of suffering went on rising , the fever rose higher each evening and the nights were increasingly restless .
The team of leading physicians and surgeons who came periodically from Calcutta insisted on his removal to Calcutta for a major operation .
The decision upset the patient who had little faith in allopathic claims and resented the idea of physical mutilation perpetrated on him in the name of scientific surgery . - But he was helpless .
Even Gandhi had to yield and submit to an operation .
" Why ca n ' t I be allowed to die in peace ? " he protested .
" Momently I feel the time draws near for me to leave . "
They would miss no chance , however feeble , of saving a life so valuable , And he could not reject the importunities of the dear and near ones .
So he yielded most reluctantly and against his better instinct .
He would have liked nothing better than to breathe his last at Santiniketan , surrounded by those he loved best , men and women , children and the trees , his very own , as it were .
He was unhappy to leave the site he had cherished so dearly and where almost every lree had grown under his care . " Perhaps I shall not see these trees again , " he murmured .
On 25 July he was taken to Calcutta .
It was so ordained , and perhaps it was right , that he should spend his last days under the same old ancestral roof where he had spent his first .
Two days later he dictated a poem whose brevity , concentrated strength as of a mantra and daring of thought match the best in the Rig Veda .
An answer either way would be naive , too simple to be true .
Tagore ' s is really an affirmation of a truth that is beyond faith and doubt , or is inclusive of both doubt and faith .
What the poet uttered was the stark truth thatoi the ultimate mystery of life and the universe he has no knowledge .
What he really is beneath and beyond the body , he does not know .
But he was not a materialist or a nihilist as the words are normally understood .
He believed that life is bigger than death and the spirit of man bigger than life , and that life , nature and the world of matter are linked together and governed by a universal law whose principle is not mechanical but spiritual , so that the way to its understanding , however partial , is through the heart and not through the head , through love and not through ratiocination .
Basically a man of faith , his faith was brave and true , for it had been tested in the fire of suffering .
It did not rest on the artificial props of borrowed beliefs but was founded in the experience of sorrow and shone through it He had indeed inherited or imbibed in his young age many beliefs , but what in them was unreal or assumed gradually dropped off or was discarded .
The first is dated 29 July , four days after his arrival in Calcutta . Sorrow ' s dark night , again and again , has come to my door .
But in this case he had no chance to do so .
Before he could recover from the after - effects of the operation his condition worsened and he gradually lost his consciousness , never to recover it again .
On 7 August at ten minutes past midday he breathed his last in the same old Jorasanko house where he had first opened his eyes eighty years and three months earlier .
It was the day of the full moon of Sravana , the month of rains so often celebrated in his verse and song .
He had earlier written a song which he had desired should be sung at his death . It was . It is still sung at each anniversary of the day .
These stupas and chaityas show their own distinct regional characters as against their compeers in north and north - western India .
From the sixth and seventh centuries AD , the Hindus and Jains of the south too adopted the stone medium , and started excavating rock - cut cave - temples , or carving out rock - cut monolithic temple forms , and ultimately building them of stone .
The comparative freedom from foreign invasions and disruption in this part of India and the relative strength of the kingdoms and society were some of the contributing factors .
Even the early Hindu and Jain temples came into being under the royal patronage of the rulers of the three great empires of the souththe Chalukyas , the Pallavas and the Pandyas along with the lesser kingdoms wedged in between .
The result was that a chain of temples , great and small , studded every village and town of the south , which thus came to be known as the land of temples .
Buddhism almost went into complete eclipse soon ; the Hindu temples to a greater extent and the Jain ones to a lesser extent predominating .
The Buddha , for instance , was adopted as the ninth of the ten incarnations of Vishnu in the Hindu pantheon in place of Krishna , who came to be considered as the whole aspect of Vishnu .
Thus in an integrated scheme of a study of the temples of India , the southern temples have perforce to be studied independently in order to understand not only their origin and mode of development through time and space into the varied regional styles , but also the similarities and differences and the mutual influences of the two great traditions , northern and southern .
An attempt has been made in the following pages to portray in outline the temples of the south .
Since even the simplest architectural and art terms of the European classical origin , often employed in the description of Indian temples , are inadequate and not always apt , the barest use of Indian technical terms of common Sanskrit origin for the most important parts , as used in the Vastu and Silpa manuals , has been made .
The cult of worship of objects or phenomena considered superhuman in a specified manner and in specified places has been one of the traits of mankind from very remote times .
The early form of such practices can only be deduced from literary evidences , traditions and material relics that have come down to us in the course of the centuries .
A fairly vivid picture of life and organized worship in the the ancient Tamilakam , the country of the Tamils , in the southernmost part of the peninsula that included what is now Kerala also , is supplied by the earliest available literature in Tamil , dating from the commencement of the Christian era , if not before it .
The extant portion of this vast literature embodies in itself earlier and contemporary traditions , many of which still persist .
These monuments which are funerary or sepulchral in character are , by far , the largest group of extant early monuments in the south and are very widely distributed all over the area south of the Vindhyas .
All these would constitute a class of hypaethral temples , that is , temples open to the air and devoid of a roof over the object of worship .
This part of the scene has three trees , with the bases of two of them enclosed by a railing .
The most prominent one on the right , with the railing around it , is shown as being worshipped by two devotees , one with folded hands and the other holding out a baby towards the tree .
This has also an inscription below it , calling it ' Bahuputm - chaitya of Vaisali ' .
This would be a rendering of a vriksha - chaitya with a simple railing denoting its antiquity , for the stele and the inscriptions are of post - Asokan times .
According to Buddha - ghosha , this was a many - branched tree where people prayed for sons .
The depiction accordingly of one praying for the boon , and the other , having obtained it , presenting it in gratitude and for it to be blessed further is appropriate .
In short , the Bodhi - ghara structures around the principal object of worship would thus anticipate the cloister galleries ( or dalans ) round the roofed temple structures , or vimanas , often more than one storeyed , enshrining the object of worship .
These cloister galleries are designated in the Tamil inscriptions and texts as malikai ( malika ) as also in the Silpa and Agama literature on temple architecture .
The only difference is that while the early examples surround hypaethral shrines which are not covered by a roof , the later malikais surround roofed shrines or vimanas containing the object of worship or the deity .
The very ancient and deep - rooted cult of tree worship continued in south India , particularly the Tamil country , even after organized temple worship of the Hindu cults had grown .
On the top of the anda is the harmika square on plan and enclosing an umbrella ( chhatra ) or a series of them ( chhatravali ) .
In the earlier and simpler examples , these are merely plastered over , with a large looped garland girdling the anda picked out in stucco as an adornment .
The harvest of his field has been gathered and he fills the boat with it .
The boat goes on its way , no one knows where , and the poet is left behind on the bank , forlorn .
There was a time when a storm of controversy raged in the literary circles of Bengal as to the real meaning of this poem .
What is the Golden Boat and who is at its helm ?
The author himself explained that the Boat symbolised for him Life which collects the harvest of our achieve - ment and goes floating on the stream of time , leaving us behind .
The Golden Boat reappears in the last poem of the book , but now the poet has been taken into the boat .
His lost playmate , his Muse , the Beloved of his dreams , his guardian angel , half - known and half - unknown , is at the helm .
Will hope yield at last its golden harvest ? "
You looked at my face and smiled And said not a word .
For example , Hinduism , particularly in the Tamil country , which included much of Kerala also , became eclectic by absorbing the local deities and concepts in the pantheon and ritual , or by identifying them with many of its own .
Iconic forms of Siva , Vishnu , Surya , Kartikeya , Sri , Durga and other gods were also evolved .
This synthesis , in effect , resulted , after due growth during the five succeeding centuries ( between the eighth and the thirteenth ) , in the contribution of the south to the common heritage of India of unique forms and concepts , for example , the form and concept of Siva as Nataraja and Dakshinamurti , Devi as Lalita , the bhakti cult of the Nayanmars and Alvarsthe Saiva and Vaishnava hagiologistsand the great philosophies of Advaita , Visishtadvaita and Dvaita of Sankara , Ramanuja and Madhva .
This resulted in the delayed development of its indigenous literatures which thus do not supply much material regarding the purely local traditions and beliefs of the very early times .
But many contemporary material relics indicating the religious forms and places of worship are extant and have come up , as in north India , in the latest excavations .
These relics also reveal the fact that the temples or shrines had a common plan , design and mode of construction , irrespective of the creeds to which they belonged .
The earliest caves excavated by Asoka and his grandson Dasaratha into the very hard local rock ( quartzose - gneiss ) are in the Barabar and Nagarjuni hills near Gaya .
The most important examples of this group are the Sudama ( Nyagrodha ) and the Lomas Rishi caves .
These two caves exactly reproduce the plan of the Suddhamma Deva Sabha in the Barhut relief .
They include chaitya halls , which were really temples or places of worship ; the object of worship being a stupa representing the Buddha , and viharas , or monasteries , each with a number of cells opening into a large central assembly - hall .
Such examples are found in the vicinity of Poona and Nasik , and Ajanta and Aurangabad .
The choice of this area was due to . the fact that the softer trap rocks were more easy to work on than the hard granites or gneisses , as in Gaya .
Among these the Buddhist cave at Kondivte in Salsette , the Tulaja cave in Junnar , near Poona , and the cave in Guntupalle in Andhra bear comparison with the Sudama and Lomas Rishi caves near Gaya .
One of the most beautiful poems in the book is an ode to ' Urvasi , the legendary Teminine of Hindu mythology who seduces saints and captivates the hearts of all men .
Rabindranath pictures her as arising out of the foam of the primal ocean when it was churned by the godsnaked and flawless beauty , holding nectar in her right hand and poison in her left .
Urvasi is the eternal woman , whom . men have always desired but never possessed , for she is " not mother , not daughter , not bride . "
The term over and merit exhausted , the soul is about to return to earth and compares the chilly joy and unruffled peace of heaven with the woven web of joys and sorrows which is the life on earth .
The poem is one long paean in praise of this lowly earth and its siniple human attachments .
The struggle between the poet ' s heart enchanted with its own music and his conscience troubled by the plight of his countrymen finds passionate utterance in a long poem entitled " Turn me back now " .
It is a poem such as Mahatma Gandhi might have written had he been a poet .
He describes the condition of his people , hungry , naked and homeless in their own land , bereft of human rights and bereft of even the will to protest .
The linga - pitha is generally square , but octagonal in the eastern cave - temple , at Malai - yakkovil .
In the Siva shrine of the Tirup - parankunram cave - temple , there is a Somaskanda panel on the rear wall , as in the Pallava cave - temples of the close of the seventh century and subsequent structural temples .
In the cave - temples at Piranmalai and Tirumalai ( Ramanathapuram district ) it is only Siva and Parvati ( Umasahitamurti ) seated , without Skanda .
Such icons found for example on the rear wall of the shrine in the cave - temples of Piranmalai and Tirumalai ( Ramanathapuram district ) , and on the north wall of the rock - cut front mandapa of the Kunnandarkoil ( Pudukkbttai district ) cave - temple are reminiscent of the Siva - Parvati wedlock , or vaivahika form of Minakshi - Sundaresvara , prevalent in that region .
In the lower rock - cut cave - temple at Tiruchirapalli ( Paindya ) , while the two lateral shrine - cells are dedicated to Siva and Vishnu , the rear wall of the mandapa has five niches enclosed by pilasters , the central one with Brahma and the others with Ganesa , Subrahmanya , Surya and Durga .
The larger cave - temple at Tirup - parankunram takes in five out of the six deities , excluding Surya , for the two principal lateral shrines are dedicated to Siva and Vishnu , while a third , for Durga , has been cut out of the rear wall at its centre with the two recesses on either side having sculptures of Ganesa and Subrahmanya .
The Western Gangas of Talkad in south Mysore , following the Chalukya - Rashtrakuta idiom , have left two unfinished cave - temples in the hard rock at Melkote near Mysore .
In addition to the incorporation of the Chalukyan traits noted above , these southern cave - temples , essentially following the Pallava Mahendra - style and hard rock tradition , also reproduce many iconic forms that are found in the Pallava rock - cut and structural examples .
The more important ones are the reproduction of Durga with a devotee cutting off his own head in sacrifice , a common Pallava form , reproduced near the Vishnu cave - temple of Tiruttangal , and the Mahishasuramardini group , as at Mahabalipuram and Saluvankuppam , reproduced with variations in the Vagisvaram cave - temple at Malai - yadippatti .
The Bhu - Varaha and Gajalakshmi forms are found in the cave - temples at Tirup - parankunram and the Trivikrama form along with Bhu - Varaha in the cave - temple at Namakkal .
The other iconographic forms so reproduced are Lingodbhava , Harihara , Subrahmanya , Vishnu with garuda in human form , Narasimha , and the tandava forms , of Siva .
The Kerala cave - temples of a rather indeterminate authorship , however , form an important landmark in southern cave architecture combining as they do the features of the Pandya and the Adigaiman cave - temples of the adjoining territory and like them are essentially of the Pallava Mahendra - style model both in their granite rock material and the plan and technique of excavation , though with an import often of some Chalukyan motifs .
The incomplete Branthanpara excavation demonstrates the familiar Pallava technique of rock excavation as at Mahabalipuram , fol - lowed in the Pandya - Muttaraiyar - Adigaiman areas , as at Narttamalai , Mangadu and other places . The cave at Vizhinam , of the rock - cell type without the front mandapa and characteristic of the Pandya - Muttaraiyar region , is unique in having on either rock flank of its door - opening , reliefs of Siva in chatura tandava with Parvati in attendance on one side , and Siva with bow as kirata , followed by a dwarf gana on the other .
These bas - relief sculptures are more akin to the Pallava than to the neighbouring Pandya forms .
At Irunilamkodu , another simple diminutive single - cell excavation without any facade or front porch , is a fine sculpture of Yoga Dakshinamurti in a majestic pose on the south wall , with an attendant rishi and disciples below , while the linga proper is placed in a small niche cut into the western wall over a platform .
The other cave - temples are those at Tirunandikkara and Kaviyur .
A Nandi - mandapa is also to be seen in front in some cases as in the Lankesvara cave at Ellora ( Kailasa complex ) .
The fourth type is exemplified by the structures where the principal shrine has no circumambulatory passage , that is , nirandhara : the ardha - mandapa has sculpture panels on its side walls , and the large maha - mandapa is pillared and with or without side shrines .
The Saptamatrika shrine , or niche , is cut independently outside the main cave - temple , usually on its left flank , while there is a Nandi - mandapa in front , as in Ellora Cave 22 .
The fifth group would be that where the sandhara pattern with circumambulation develops a sarvatobhadra sanctum cell , with door - openings on all the four sides , fronted by a series of two or three mandapas , and , in the most advanced type , having an additional agra - mandapa that contains sculpture panels of Ganesa , Durga and other forms on one side and the Saptamatrikas on the other side of the agm - mandapa .
Lastly , there are the examples which , like the more southern forms , have in front the transversely oblong hallsthe ardha - and mukha - mandapas , without any vedi parapet for the latter , and where the pillars carry the sculptures on their shaft portions instead of on the bracket region as female figures that are usual in other cases .
Thus the main varieties observed in the Chalukyan cave - temples are with individual variations : the nirandhara type where the shrine - cells are devoid of a circumambulatory passage as at Badami , the sandhara type with shrine - cells having a circumambulatory passage as at Ellora , Ramesvara , etc . , the trikuta type with triple shrine - cells as at Aihole and Ellora , and the sarvatobhadra type with shrine - cells having door - openings on all the four sides as at Elephanta , Ellora and Jogeshvari .
The sandhara and sarvatobhadra forms are the most outstanding .
In the sarvatobhadra types , as seen in the Dhumarlena at Ellora , the principal cave at Elephanta , and in the cave at Jogeshvari , the outer mandapa cut out of the rock tends to have at least three open passages on the three sides , while the fourth at the rear forms the one ending in the parent rock .
The heaviness of the Chalukyan pillars as at Badami is apparently reduced by the flutings and carvings ; the pillar and corbel shapes are various , but in their development they retain their individuality till the close of the Chalukyan period and do not recur in the Rashtrakuta creations .
The embellished median band , or patta , common in the Chalukyan corbels , is absent .
Though smaller than the Badami cave - temples , these are interesting from the point of view of plan , design and sculpture .
The pillar ' s are more slender and have the usual capital components of the ' order ' .
The Ravalagudi consists essentially of an almost square mandapa with a large principal cella of almost equal size on the rear , and two more , wide , lateral shrines , thus making a trikuta plan .
While the rear shrine has a rock - cut linga , the lateral shrine on its right is dedicated to the Saptamatrikas and attendant deities , and the one on the left to other forms of Siva .
The slightly projecting dividing wall - strips between the mandapa and rear shrine , leaving a wide entrance in between , carry the dvarapala sculptures .
On the facade on either flank on the rock wall are niches containing the sculptures of the two nidhisSankha and Padma .
The Jain cave - temple has a front mandapa which is more pronouncedly rectangular , and conforms to the typical mandapa - type cave - temple pattern .
The high trap - ridge at Ellora which had afforded the venue for a series of Buddhist excavations described earlier , now provided a scope for Hindu and Jain works .
The Brahmanical cave - temples , occupying the central section of the hill and the parts higher up , belong to the period of the Chalukyas and their Rashtrakuta successors .
The Hindu excavations , designated as Caves 13 to 29 , are mostly Saivite in character and fall into two distinct chronological series , the earlier series being more after the models of the preceding Buddhist excavations , characterized by the general absence of a rock - cut image or symbol like the linga in their sanctums .
There are , of course , variations of plan and content in some .
Cave 16 is the Kailasa complex , where the main part is the monolithic vimana temple of Kailasa with cave - temples on the scarp of the circumambulatory passage as in the case of the Lankesvara ( 16a ) .
The later series are more after the models of the south and often contain an image in their sanctum , a rock - cut linga pedestal with sometimes a rock - cut Nandi also ,
' The pillars in these caves are of a varied nature and design and are square or octagonal in section , or , generally , of the kumbha - valli type with full vases and excrescent foliage at the middle height , or they have cushion - shaped kumbha mouldings in their capitals .
The corbels , where present , are either simple or ornate .
The Ramesvara ( Cave 21 ) would represent the earliest of this group .
The facade of the rectangular mukha - mandapa has four short , bulky , ornate pillars , and two pilasters at either end rising above a highly decorated vedi parapet , or dwarf wall , interrupted in the middle between the two central pillars to provide the entrance doorway .
But tell me , have you nothing more to ask for than leave to depart ?
Have all your desires been fulfilled none left lingering in your heart to prick like a hidden thorn ? "
" None , " Kacha assures her .
" Then you must be the one happy being in creation , " taunts Devayani . " Go back to your Paradise and add to its splendour your own triumph .
There they are waiting to welcome you back with music and conch shells and flowers .
Ah , Brahmin , you have indeed spent hard and dreary days here , drudging in an alien land , with no one to comfort and delight you . "
Kacha feels the sting and begs , " Not thus with a reproach , but with a smile bid me farewell . "
" Smile !
This is no Paradise , my friend .
Smiles are not so cheap in this world where longing like a worm in the flower gnaws at the heart ' s core , where desire like a baffled bee hovers round the closed petals of the heart ' s lotus .
The Patalesvara at Poona has Gajalakshmi , Tripurantaka , Anantasayin , Lingodbhava and Andhakari .
Mahur depicts Ardhanari , Gangadhara , Tripurantaka , Ganesa , Kartikeya and Surya .
THE EASTERN CHALUKYAN CAVE - TEMPLES OF COASTAL ANDHRA In the Andhra coastal region , excavated into the softer rocks on either bank of the Krishna in the territory of the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi , there are over a dozen cave - temples .
They are to be found in the hills of Vijayawada and Mogulrajapuram on the north bank , all in Krishna district , and in the hills of Undavalli , Penamaga , and Sitaramapuram on the south bank in Guntur district .
These cave - temples of Eastern Chalukyan authorship show individualistic characters in their lay - out , iconography and the scheme of the cella .
They partake in some respects of the neighbouring Pallava modes , apart from their parental Chalukyan and northern inheritance .
In Bhairavakonda , the socket is cut in a sunken recess on the wall over the pedestal to take in the linga , or image . In respect of the cave temples of the Eastern Chalukyas , the absence of Vishnu carvings is notable as against what is found in the Western Chalukyan - Rashtrakuta group .
Practically all the cave - temples are Saiva , or are dedicated to other deities of the Saiva pantheon .
More often , however , it is the result of gradual additions during various periods , thus successively enlarging the original lay - out and resulting in such larger temple complexes , or temple cities , as those at Chidambaram , Tiruvannamalai , Madurai and Srirangam .
The temple cities , so called , such as Srirangam , which is the largest of the lot , accommodate the residential houses of people connected with the temple inside of the outer circuits .
In Srirangam , for example , where the primary temple nucleus of Ranganatha ( recumbentVishnu ) is surrounded by seven concentric prakaras or enclosure walls , the inner four walls invest the various subsidiary shrines and festival mandapas while the outer three walls have residential houses and mansions ranged along their inside faces , which are also called malikai ( malika ) .
These along with other houses and streets outside the outermost seventh prakara , constitute a modem municipal town .
As in all three - dimensional constructions where the plan and elevation aspects count , it is the diverse nature of the plan , and the degree of rise , involving the elaboration of the number of talas or storeysthe talachchanda , as it is calledthat result in the great variety of southern vimanas leading to their differentiation and classification into categories .
The four - sided square or oblong plans , and the curvilinearcircular , elliptical and apsidal plansbecome familiar even in the earlier Buddhist and non - Buddhist temples .
But the hexagonal or octagonal plan that is found introduced in the make - up of the southern vimana would be rather uncommon .
In the matter of rise the simple or ekatala vimana consists essentially of six vertical components , which , from base to apex , would be ( 1 ) the adhishthana , or basement , ( 2 ) the pada , or pillar , or the bhitii , or wall , according as the structure stands on either or both of these supports enclosing the sanctum , ( 3 ) the prastara or architrave , with the prominent cornice , or kapota , ( 4 ) the griva or clerestory over sanctum terrace and entablature , ( 5 ) the sikhara or ultimate roof covering the top of the clerestory or griva , and ( 6 ) the stupi or finial crowning the top of the sikhara .
The number of storeys could be increased to three or four ( tritala , chatushtala , etc . ) , in which case they were called jati vimanas .
But duty calls and he must , even at the sacrifice of his happiness , go back to his peoplfe and put his knowledge at their service .
He begs to be forgiven .
What forgiveness , O Brahmin , is left in the heart of a woman flamed to the fury of a thunderbolt ?
You will go back to the celestial realm where all regrets will be lost in the pride of your success .
But what is left to me here what ambition or mission can instil a meaning or pride in this thwarted and barren life of mine ?
In these woods must I drag on the humiliation of an aimless and forlorn existence , where memory with its thousand thorns will prick me at each ' turn and a secret shame gnaw at the very core of my being .
Shame be yours , O heartless adventurer , who came and sat through the sunny hours in the shade of my life ' s garden and to while away time plucked all its flowers and wove them into a garland , only to snap the thread at the end and scatter all the glory of a woman ' s heart into dust !
Be this my curse at farewell may the knowledge for whose sake you have spurned me never bear its full reward for you !
You shall bear its burden and not enjoy its use , you will teach it but shall never be able to practise it . "
They later develop a central projecting tenon , or double volute , or assume the shape of a projecting curved arm terminated by a pendentive lotus bud , the pushpa potikas of the temples of the fifteenth century and later .
These shapes indicate regional developments and also chronological evolution .
Another , important architectural feature is the torana which is essentially an arched festoon ( occasionally straight as in the toranas of Sanchi ) , mounted over two columns and marking a sacred or ceremonial entrance .
Such free - standing torana entrances or stambha toranas are stated to have preceded the gopura entrances of ancient palaces .
But while the entrance torana has been retained in the northern monuments , as at Sanchi and Bhubaneswar , it is the gopura entrance that has prevailed in the south and forms the most characteristic and invariable part of the temple complex .
The torana idea is , however , not lost ; the motif is applied to many niches and entrances on the body of the vimana or the gopura and are known as bhitti tomnas .
These are found to frame the entrances of some cave - temples , the fronts of the niches , or devakoshthas , on the walls of the vimana , and the fronts of the nasikas of various orders and sizesthe mahanasika , the sukanasika , the kshudra - nasika , and the alpanasika .
The gable - window - like arched kudu ornaments on the kapota , of the prastara are fronted by toranas bereft of the supporting columns .
In its simplest and most primary form it would consist of an offset bottom course , the upana , a taller neck - like recessed vertical course , the kantha , and a projecting platform , the prati or pattika .
A slight elaboration would be the insertion of a torus moulding called the kumnda which is three - faceted ( tripatta ) , or rounded ( vritta ) , and placed above the kantha and below the pattika , having another plain moulding , less offset than the upana but taller and coming over it , called the jagati .
When closed they have a series of pilasters against the inner faces of the walls .
On their outer faces the external scheme obtaining in the main vimana is followed .
The pillars are mostly of the simple type , with the top and bottom sections square on plan and with the intervening section octagonal or polygonal , as in the case of the southern rock - cut cave - temples which , on that account , are popularly called mandapa - temples .
The names Kotikal mandapam , Orukal mandapam , Idaichi mandapa , etc . indicate this .
Such simple mandapa pillars do not have differentiated capital mouldings , but bear the potika or corbel block directly over the top square section .
They may occasionally have the full capitals of the order or , as in the case of the cave - temples of the Deccan , they may be of the kumbha - valli type or have the so - called cushion capitals mentioned earlier .
In later mandapa of the Chalukyan series , the pillars above their square base are rendered into a series of curved and rounded shapes by being turned on a lathe .
In later mandapas of the Pallava - Pandya series , the pillars have attached portrait statues , animal figures or a number of columnettes called ani - yotti - k - kal .
A small upright free - standing rock just in front of the Draupadi ratha that would have hidden its front view has been shaped into a large sculpture of a standing lion facing north .
Of the other four rathas , the Ganesa ratha has been cut out of a boulder amidst the main hill in Mahabalipuram , and the two Pidari rathas ( northern and southern , so called because they are near the modern temple of the village goddess Pidari ) and the Valaiyankuttai ratha ( standing in front of the Valaiyankuttai pond ) are shaped out of free - standing boulders at a distance on the western side of the main hill .
The small Draupadi ratha illustrates the type of a very simple hut - like vimana , square on plan , with only four of the usual six angas of the vimana , namely , adhishthana , pada and bhitti , sikhara and stupi , the angas that are lacking being the prastara and griva .
This chaturvarga ratha represents the kuta type with a four - sided domical roof , or sikhara , crowned by a single stupi or finial .
In having a square platform base to apex , it exemplifies the pure Nagara order .
It is dedicated to Durga whose standing sculpture in relief , with attendants , is carved on the rear wall of the sanctum .
The main doorway is framed by a fine torana as also the three devakoshthas which also enshrine standing relief sculptures of Durga on the three side walls .
On either side of the doorway are flanking dvampalikas , one on either side in the niche between the corner plaster and the torana pilaster framing the entrance . This ratha lacks a mukha - or ardha - mandapa , unlike the other rathas , as also the nasikas projected from the sikhara .
A dvitala and hence ashtanga , or ashtavarga vimana of the same Nagara order , square from base to apex is illustrated in the incomplete Valaiyankuttai ratha facing east .
It has a small ardha - mandapa and the aditala has a single wall , hence it is nirandhara .
This was perhaps commenced by Mamalla , as indicated by the label inscribed on the eastern side of the second tala , and was brought to its present stage of completion with the consecration of the top tala by Paramesvaravarman , as the labels on the top tala would denote .
In the Dharmaraja ratha what apparently looks like the outer wall of the aditala cantoning the corners leaving open - pillared entrances on the four cardinals , in between , is really the wall of an outer , narrow peripheral mandapa investing the aditala or groundfloor shrine .
The pattern is really one where the wall of the aditala garbha - griha or cella rises up as the outer wall of the second tola sanctum which is render sandham with an inner wall , in addition , that rises up higher as the wall of the third tala of lesser linear dimensions than the ones below .
The incomplete Bhima ratha appears to be pseudo - sandhara , like the Dharmaraja ratha , in that its oblong aditala is surrounded by a narrow mandapa with walls round the corners and intervening open facades of two pillars and two pilasters on the long and short sides , the pillars and pilasters being vyala - based .
The mandapa carries above its prastara a ham of kutas at the four corners and sala in between , over the sides .
The oblong sanctum facing west was perhaps intended for a reclining form of Vishnu with his head to the south and legs to the north .
The oblong griva , which rises as an upper continuation of the garbha - griha walls , is rather tall .
On each of the two long sides of the griva sikhara are five well - projected nasikas in three sizes , the central one being the largest , the extreme ones middling , and the intermediate one being the smallest .
The three larger ones represent full nasikas with the prastara element in their composition .
But even a deeper conflict is that of personal loyalties .
Should one , if faced with a relentless choice , betray one ' s conscience or one ' s religion , one ' s country or one ' s faith , the " pledge of friendship or that of love ?
There is no answer to this dilemma and the choice must take its tragic course .
The next major volume of verse , Chaitali , was published in 1896 .
Chaitali means a late harvest , the last gleanings of rice gathered in the month of Chaitra ( March - April ) , before the fierce sun of May burns out the last drop of moisture from the earth .
It was as though the poet was . dimly aware that the period of his life ' s Spring was drawing to a close , the emotional exuberance and intellectual recklessness of early manhood would soon shed many of its leaves and petals in the hot blasts of an increasing spiritual austerity .
A gentle , brooding sadness lurks in the mood these poems and a dim foreboding of the parting of these poems and a dim foreboding of the parting of ways .
Before the sense of India ' s past overwhelms him in the next phase , he will glean a few immortal moments from the immediate present .
Occasionally also , one or more of the other seven parivara shrines deviate in form , as , for example , the apsidal or gaja - prishtha ( elephant back ) sub - shrine for Gajanana or Ganesa found in the Sundaresvara temple at Nangavaram ( Tiruchirapalli district ) .
The cult of Chandesa as the mulabhritya , or chief seneschal of a Siva temple , which had its emergence even in the time of Rajasimha Pallava as seen in his Kailasanatha at Kanchi , had now become crystallized and one of the ashta parivara sub - shrines on the north was assigned to him till about AD 1000 .
The Balasubrahmanya temple at Kannanur and the Siva temple at Viralur ( both in Pudukkottai district ) are examples of the kind where the griva and sikhara are circular in section , mounted over the square body of the ekatala vimana .
The former carries on the four corners of its aditala four elephant figures as symbols for Subrahmanya Kartikeya , instead of the later and usual peacock forms .
The dvitala Talinatha temple at Tiruppattur ( Ramanathapuram district ) and the similar Siva temple in Tiruvalisvaram ( Tirunelveli district ) are slightly larger examples .
The former has four karnakuta miniature shrines at the corners of the topmost tala in place of the Nandis .
The latter is noted for its fine sculptures and cameos in relief on its walls and superstructure , amongst which is to be found the well - known ananda - tandava of Siva Nataraja , perhaps the earliest depiction of this characteristically crystallized and sublimated concept of Tamil Nadu and its unique contribution to Indian and world art .
The celebrated icon of Nataraja in the characteristic ananda - tandava pose , depicting , esoterically , the pancha kritya of Siva of Tamilian Saiva Siddhanta , as ably described and interpreted by Coomaraswamy , makes its advent late in the ninth century .
The Saiva saint , Manikkavachakar is the first among the Nayanmars to refer to this form and aspect of Siva ' s dance and the small Tiruvalisvaram panel ( c . AD 890 ) is perhaps the first to capture the imagery in stone .
It occurs as a niche sculpture in stone , perhaps for the first time , in the devakoshtha of the south wall of the ardha - mandapa in the temple at Konerirajapuram ( Thanjavur district ) and becomes a usual feature in that position in the other early Chola temples .
The Vijayalaya Cholisvaram in Narttamalai ( Pudukkottai district ) , though so called after the founder of the Chola line of Thanjavur , is an interesting and fine Muttaraiyar example .
The sandhara aditala of this tritala structure is square on plan externally with an almost equal - sized closed mandapa in front , while its inner wall enclosing the sanctum is circular , leaving an intervening passage all round .
The second tala rising over the inner circular wall is square , while the third , as also the griva and sikhara above , is circular in section .
The aditala ham , extended over the top of the front mandapa , also shows a series of dance sculptures .
But for these and the dvarapalas at the mandapa entrance , the sculptures on the four faces at the top and the cylindrical linga with circular pitha in the sanctum , there are not many sculptures .
The west - facing complex is surrounded by the ashta parivara and a prakara with a small gopura entrance on the east located near the north - east corner at the top of a slopy ascent on the rock over which the temple is built .
Its two square lower talas of the superposed sanctum type , with a double - walled square sandhara aditala leaving a passage in between the walls are functional and have tirthankara forms enshrined in their sanctums .
The hara of the aditala over the top of the outer wall , consisting of kuta , sala and panjara elements , is continued over the top edges of the front mandapas .
The hara contains a series of fine sculptures .
This was the work of Chavundaraya , the minister of Ganga Rachamalla ( 974 - 984 ) .
The base of the colossus is surrounded by a malika of granite , built by Gangaraya , the minister of Hoysala Vishnuvardhana ( 1110 - 1152 ) , and the mandapa abutting the lower part of the colossus from behind was built by another minister , Baladeva , in the twelfth century .
The Ganga temple at Kambadahalli near Sravana Belagola , also Jain , is interesting on account of the fact that its three principal vimanas of moderate dimensions and built wholly of granite open into the three sides of a common mandapa , the fourth side of which on the north affords the common outer entrance a grouping called trikuta .
To this complex have been added two more lateral vimanas in front of the common mandapa of the trikuta nucleus .
The whole is surrounded by a prakara with a small gopura entrance on the north .
This complex called Panchakuta basti ( Jam temple ) in Kambadahalli ( Hassan district ) , besides being a unique combination of units illustrating the ternary classification of the southern vimanas as Nagara , Dravida and Vesara , is interesting in its other aspects too .
Particularly may be mentioned the variety of niche toranas framing the devakoshthas , that depict the different forms of toranas described in the texts and inscriptions , such as the patra torana , chitra torana , makara torana , vidyadhara torana , etc .
This temple complex in thus exemplifying the various features of the vimana form as enumerated and codified in the Silpa and Agama texts of the period , can be said to be a perfect text - book illustration or specimen to be studied in comparison with the texts .
The granite temples of Nandi ( Kolar district ) , the capital of the Banas , are of Ganga - Nolamba extraction .
The small and earlier Yoganandisvara on top of the hill is not architecturally impressive , while the larger twin temples of Bhoganandisvara and Arunachalesvara , both of the square type , at the foot of hill are .
This nuclear twin is enlarged with the addition of later axial mandapas and peripheral structures into a complex with prakara and gopura on the east .
The Bhoganandisvara , earlier of the two , is evidently a renovation of a pre - existing structure , and is noted for the fineness of its structure and beauty of its sculptures .
The Arunachalesvara would appear to be almost a later copy of the Bhoganandisvara .
Thus it would appear to be no more than a large assembly hall converted into a temple with a shrine inside at the rear .
The large mandapa of the Ladkhan temple with its improvised shrine at the rear with an unconventional slopy roof standing on an adhishthana of its own was rightly suspected to have been originally the hall of the village moot ( Percy Brown ) .
A case in point will be what is nowadays called the Vaikunthaperumal temple in Uttiramerur ( Chingleput district ) , a later Pallava structure , which we have not noticed in our preceding account of temples of the period .
What is extant of this sabha - mandapa or grand assembly hall of Uttirameru - Chaturvedi mangalam , constructed , evidently for the village sabha or assembly , is only the magnificent , stone - built plinth , the upa - pitha and the adhishthana , the columned superstructure that stood over it having been lost .
The extant moulded basement is in hard granite stone .
An inscription of the twenty - fourth year of Pallava Nandivarman III , on the extant structure itself calls it a mandapa , not a temple ( vimana ) .
The structure is of the time of Dantivarman ( AD 796 - 846 ) .
Incidentally it carries the famous inscription of the twelfth and fourteenth years of Parantaka I Chola ( AD 919 - 921 ) , laying down the rules and conditions for eligibility in elections to and the manner of the constitution of the village assemblyperhaps the earliest inscription known as relating to elections to the village administrative bodies .
These temples have all a typically Chalukyan plinth form , with nirandhara or single - walled aditala and with a narrower ardha - mandapa in front .
By about AD 1000 , imperial Chola power had reached its zenith , its authority having spread over the entire Tamil region and Kerala , parts of south Mysore and coastal Andhra , and even overseas to Sri Lanka , the Andamans , the Laccadives and the Maldives .
The contemporary rival power , the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan , soon gave way to the resurgent Chalukyas of Kalyani , the Western Chalukyas or later Chalukyas , as they are often called .
With the experience and know how acquired in stone construction , technique and design , and with the forms and norms crystallized into codified Agama and Silpa manuals , the period that followed witnessed great activity in the construction of temples , particularly the great ones of south India and Sri Lanka .
THE CHOLA AND THE LATER PANDYA SERIES The Brihadisvara temple at Thanjavur closely followed by the Brihadisvara at Gangaikondacholapuram ( Tiruchirapalli district ) mark the acme of the southern vimana architecturein magnitude , quality of design , technique and embellishment .
The great temple at Thanjavur , appropriately called the Brihadisvara , or the Rajarajesvara after its builder Rajaraja I , conceived as a whole complex on a grand scale and completed by the founder , constitutes the most ambitious undertaking and achievement of the Tamilian architect .
It combines all that is best in temple - building traditionarchitecture , sculpture , painting and allied arts .
It is a large complex with an enormous monolithic Nandi recumbent on a high pedestal in front of the vimana and its coeval axial mandapa , but now sheltered in a mandapa of a much later date .
A rich disciple proud of his wealth came to the Sikh Guru and offered a pair of gold bangles in wrought with precious stones .
The Guru let one bangle slip from his hand into the river below .
The disciple jumped into the river to retrieve the costly gift .
Failing to find it he begged the Guru to indicate the exact spot where it had fallen .
The Guru threw the remaining bangle into the water and said , " There ! "
Here is one about an ancient Hindu sage who taught the sacred sciences to young Brahmins .
A little boy , poor but eager to learn , came and begged ' to be accepted as a pupil .
The sage asked him if he was a Brahmin and who his father was .
The child ran to his mother to inquire and came back and reported that his mother said she had no husband and all the wealth that God had given her was in her little boy .
The sage embraced the boy and said , " You are the best of Brahmins , for you have inherited the noblest heritage truth . "
The Kasi - Visvesvara temple at Lakkundi , and the Mahadeva temple at Ittagi , also not far from Gadag , mark among others the zenith of architecture and art in this area under the Western Chalukyas .
The date of the latter temple is precisely indicated by its inscription as AD 1112 .
The main vimana , extant only up to the griva , the sikhara and stupi having been lost , is a square five - storeyed structure standing on an elaborately moulded adhishthana with a sukanasika projected from the level of the fourth tala over the antarala roof .
The entire vimana on each side is thrown out into five prominent bays , the central one being the most projected , with four narrower recesses in between , the bays again offset repeatedly , so that the plan is apparently a scalloped one .
The hara on each side of the tala in correspondence with the width of the bays is made of two karnakutas , one at either end , a central sola , and two intervening panjaras .
The most projected central bay of each side of the aditala with sala superstfucture embraces deep arid broad niches forming miniature sanctums , making the whole appear like lesser vimanas , with their pillars , prastara and superstructure clustering round the ' base of the central one , while the corner ones , corresponding to the karnakutas , have narrower and shallower fronts .
The navaranga forms a larger square in front , its outer walls and adhishthana similarly relieved and recessed , and with similar external ornamentation .
What is more interesting is its highly ornate and raised central ceiling , and the fine carvings on its tier slabs , particularly those cutting the corners of the ceiling of square bays .
This mandapa is provided with three entrances , east , south and north , with pillared porches , the front one connecting it with an open multi - pillared agra - mandapa axially in front , which again has three porches on its three sides .
The excessive decorative elements of this temple , as also the plan and other features , indicate its proximity in time to the typical temples of the Hoysalas and Kakatiyas who came after them to power in this region in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries .
There is the Buddhist tale of the monk Upagupta , a disciple of the Buddha .
This handsome young monk was sleeping on the ground outside the city wall of Mathura when suddenly something struck against his chest and he woke up with a start .
Vasavadatta , the beautiful courtesan of the city , had stumbled against him in the dark on her way to a tryst with a lover .
She turned her lantern on the monk and seeing how handsome he was , invited him to go with her to her house , for " this hard and rough ground is no bed for you . "
The monk looked at her and said softly , " O bunch of loveliness , not yet .
Go where you are going now . When the time comes I shall myself come to you . "
The days passed and one day as the monk was passing again by the city wall he noticed a woman lying sick and abandoned on the ground .
The monk sat down beside the unconscious body and raising the woman ' s head rested it in his lap , poured water on her dry lips , smeared the body with cool and fragrant sandal paste and chanted prayers for her recovery .
The woman opened her eyes and asked , " Who are y6u , O merciful one ? " The monk answered , " Vasavadatta , I have come to keep my tryst . "
In another poem called , " The Loss is Negligible , " the poet tells the following story : On a winter morning the Queen of Kashi went with her companions to bathe in the Ganges .
The Of the temples of the Kakatiyas of Orangallu , or Warangal , the temples at Hanamkonda and Palampet are the most well known , and typical of their architecture and art .
The so - called ' thousand - pillared temple ' at Hanamkonda ( Warangal district ) , built by King Prataparudra in 1162 , shows well the transition from the late Western Chalukyan to the Kakatiya style .
The main part consists of a trikuta or triple shrine of considerable dimensions and dedicated to Siva , Vishnu and Surya , all the three opening into A common mandapa on its west , north and east , respectively , and the whole standing over a common platform .
The mandapa has open corners between the three shrines and on its two sides , and its pillars inside are lathe - turned .
This is attached in front of the unit to an intervening Nandi - mandapa .
Another interesting feature of this ruined temple within the fort is the elaborate freestanding toranas marking the entrances .
The temples at Palampet ( Warangal district ) form another interesting group .
The bases of the peripheral pillars of the mandapa are also connected by a vedi and a balustrade forming the lean - back of the kakshasana .
While the main structure is of reddish sandstone , the decorations are of polished basalt or hornblende , which are stones of the hard variety .
It consists of a vimana with a mukha - mandapa in front that is provided with three projected porch entrances , preceded by flights of steps on the north , east and south , while the garbha - griha is attached to the west with a connecting antarala .
The whole stands on a prominent and well - moulded upa - pitha .
The wall of the garbha - griha over the adhishthana on each face has five prominently relieved pilasters , the central one wider than the lateral pairs , and the prastara on top has a slopy , flat , plain cornice .
The recesses between the pilasters contain the usual short and slender pilaster motif surmounted by a shrine superstructure over its abacus .
The superstructure of the main vimana , now ruined , appears to have been of four talas or storeys with a prominently projected sukanasika on the front side over the antarala , a Nandi placed on top of it .
The main structure is like the great temple of Palampet in size , plan and elevation .
The whole stands on a double plinth , as usual , the wider upa - pitha platform below and the adhishthana , or the real base of the structures above , leaving an open ambulatory all round .
Over the adhishthana of the mandapa there is the usual dwarf wall , or vedi parapet forming kakshasanas and supporting the shorter peripheral pillars at the corners and on either side of each porch entrance .
The bracket - figures represent madanikas in graceful poses , and vyalas surmounting elephants , each with a human torso emerging out of its gape .
Inside the mandapa there are minor shrines arranged on the periphery , five of them extant , as in the Palampet temple again .
The roof of the mandapa is lost .
The sala type roof or chadya over this vestibule , rising to the height of the next vimana tala , is again a system of superposed cornices .
The sukanasa with its longer side , east - west , has a torana mukhapatti framing its front that has a framed door - opening leading into the vestibule in the lower rectangular face and the sculptured relief of dancing Siva inside the arch fronting the upper or roof part of the sukanasa , a feature that is common to temples of the Chalukyan and northern areas .
Thus this unique temple , which is a bold experiment , as it were , in the blending of architectural features , borrowed from far and near , and cleverly harmonized with a unique plan and elevational lay - out , is an interesting early Vijayanagar production of great merit .
The intention was to make it a sort of universal amalgam of different regional architectural styles with its eclectism in the sculpture too , in view of the importance of the spiritual Among the temples in Hampi following by and large the traits of the southern group may be mentioned the Vitthala temple , which is one of the largest there .
It is , in fact , a great complex planned and built at one time , with vimana , axial mandapas , garuda - mandapa , other mandapas , including kalyana - mandapas , cloister prakam and gopuras .
It was commenced by Krishnadeva Raya in 1513 and was perhaps still not completed when the empire fell in 1565 after which the capital was shifted to Penukonda .
The mandapas and gopuras are , as in all Vijayanagar temples , remarkable for their great size .
The mandapas are often of the thousand - pillared variety .
So , even as he was re - interpreting his nation ' s , moral heritage to equate it with his own universal and humanist outlook , he was at the same time pouring out his personal agonies and playing with vagaries of thought and form in a series of exquisite lyrics and songs published consecutively in three volumes , each a landmark in his own development as well as in the literature of his country .
Whatever Plato might have said of " the pleasurable Muse " she was Rabindranath ' s first and last love and whenever he strayed away from her for long , he went back to her with renewed ardour . In the very first poem of the next volume , Kalpana ( Dreams ) , he is aware of his immense need for space , even when bereft of light , and exhorts his spirit not to give up soaring , however vain the beating of its wings .
Bengali year ends in April when the hotwinds blow and violentdust - storms sweep over the plains , followed by a merciful shower . On such a day the poem was in fact written and one can still hear in its passionate rhythm the convulsive fury of the time spirit as it destroys the old and brings in the new .
But by and large the poet ' s instinctive and pagan love of nature , his voluptuous delight in its varying moods , is now weighed down with melancholy reflection .
He sees a temple in ruins and pity for the deity , neglected and unworshipped , wells up in his heart Men have found other gods .
A lovely poemwhich might also have interested Freud reproaches the god Siva for having burn to ashes , in a foolish fit of anger , the love - god Madana .
For the ashes , carried away by the wind , are now scattered all over the earth and the anguish of sex repressed never ceases to trouble men .
The poet ' s foreboding of the spiritual crisis and the cross that lay ahead of him is also reflected in several poems .
The lower part of the abacus , the pali , which was a plain doucene in the Pallava and early Chola temples and got scalloped into petals in the later Chola period , evolves still more into a floral form with the petals , idal . The corbel evolves into what is called the pushpa potika , characteristic of the Vijayanagar style , with a double - flexed arm extending , projected from the main block and scalloped at the free end as upturned petals with an incipient conical bud at the centre .
The downwardly flexed arm has a horizontal connective bar below it , connecting the free tip with the main block .
The kumbha panjara motif on the wall recesses of vimanas , gopuras and mandapas is made more ornate and elaborate .
The cornice , which was till now thick and curved down , becomes large , much thin and with a double flexure , and extends far forward , often showing the imitation in stone of the wooden ribs of the frame - work supporting it .
In the case of mandapas , like the kalyana - mandapa of the Varadaraja temple at Kanchipuram , one of the finest examples of such kind , the corners of the kapota have large stone chains dangling down , all the links , including the cornice stone - piece from which it hangs down being cut out of one stone .
These mandapas , the kalyana - or utsava - mandapas , are noted for their fine and intricately - worked colonnades in hard - stone .
The aniyottikkals , as they are called , are characteristic of the Vijayanagar style .
The superstructure of the stone vimanas or gopuras are of brick and mortar , often with timber inside if they are not built in the corbelled or kadalika karana fashion .
Such immense gopuras were added to the outermost prakara of pre - existing temple complexes of importance and are called rayagopurams , sometimes as many as eleven storeys high , as in the Ekamranatha at Kanchi , the Arunachala at Tiruvannamalai ( North Arcot district ) and the large Siva temple at Kalahasti ( Chittoor district ) , all built by the great emperor , Krishnadeva Raya ( 1502 - 1529 ) .
The Vitthala complex stands inside a high - walled , paved enclosure , with three gopura entrances , south and north .
There are also axial and accessory mandapas and ancillary shrines .
The axial series consisting of vimanas with front mandapas stands on an ornate platform , carved with friezes of men , horses , hamsa , and small shrine motifs .
The steps leading up to the frontal agra - mandapa are flanked by the large stone elephants .
The agra - mandapa itself contains huge monolithic pillars with carved - out columnettes , or with large vyalas having riders on their backs .
The superstructure of the vimana is of brickwork .
There are also shrines for other attendant deities in the courtyard .
The Krishna temple built by Krishnadeva Raya in 1513 is another handsome temple complex with the usual components of attendant shrines , the mandapas and pillared malikas and gopura .
Built by Achyuta Raya ( 1530 - 1542 ) , it is noted for its great size and huge proportions .
The Achyuta Raya temple built in 1539 is another large structure inside a double prakara with gopuras and an Amman shrine , mandapas and cloister , designed on lines similar to the famous Vitthala temple , though it will not bear comparison with that superb creation .
Its pillars are , however , handsome and it contains some fine sculptures .
The temple was dedicated to Anantasayin Vishnu , but the deity is now missing .
The shrine front has three doors to render the head , body and feet of the reclining god visible from the antarala .
Among them are the presence of the sukanasika in front of the vimana superstructure , the occurrence of the sculptures of the river goddess on the door - jambs , and ornate over - doors , often delicately carved in softstone and fitted over the plain granite door - frames , as in the temples at Tadpatri ( Anantapur district ) .
Then there is the navaranga pattern of the mandapas , as opposed to the linear multi - pillared type of the farther south , and free - standing toranas as in the temples on top of the hill at Chitaldrug ( Mysore state ) .
The Hazara Rama temple was probably begun earlier and Was completed by Krishnadeva Raya .
This temple is devoid of the characteristic gopura but its prakara walls are decorated by friezes , externally depicting dance , music and folk festivals .
The central power was much weakened .
The Vijayanagar viceroys in the southern regions , the Nayakas , gradually assumed independent powers .
Some of them fostered temple architecture and created some notable temples .
They were the Nayakas of Vellore ( North Arcot district ) , Gingee ( South Arcot district ) , Thanjavur and Madurai in Tamil Nadu , and Ikkeri in north - west Mysore .
The Nayaka period in Tamil Nadu witnessed the addition of elaborate mandapas of the hundred - pillared type , and larger gopuras with a greater number of plastic stucco figures on them , as at Vellore and Madurai , their tallest gopura superstructure being at Srivilliputtur ( Ramanathapuram district ) in front of the Vatapatrasayin temple .
The kalyana - manflapa of the Jalakanth - esvara temple at Vellore , and a similar one in the eastern prakara of the famous Ranganatha temple at Srirangam , like the earlier Vijayanagar structure in the Varadaraja temple at Kanchi , are two of the great masterpieces of the time .
They are of the multi - pillared type , having a facade row of remarkably sculptured columns carrying almost full - size monolithic figure sculptures of rearing horses with warrior - riders and retinue and other animal figures of the hunt .
Most constituents of the large temple complex at Madurai on all sides of the nuclear shrine are of Nayaka origin , mostly of the time of Tirumalai Nayaka ( 1623 - 1659 ) , including the great mandapas and towering gopuras on all the four sides .
The Pudu mandapam in the Minakshi - Sundaresvara temple at Madurai , and the front mandapa in the temple at Krishnapuram are notable examples in this respect among hundreds of others .
The Subrahmanya temple unit , with vimana ardha - and mukha - mandapas standing in the north - west court of the Brihadisvara temple complex , is a typical example of the Nayaka temple of the ornate variety and a real gem of its kind .
Built of fine - grained granite , it exhibits in the mouldings of its adhishthana and pilasters of its wall some fine and intricate engraving .
The characteristic kumbha panjara in the wall - recesses between pilasters is rendered highly ornate , as also the pushpa potika corbel of the capitals over the pillars and polygonal pilasters , with the pendent bud at the tip of the curved arm taking the shape of a full lotus bud .
The double - flexed kapota is thin and elegant showing the ribbed supporting frame - work on its under side .
The griva and sikhara of the square vimana are hexagonal , in conformity with the six - faced Shanmukha form of Subrahmanya installed in the sanctum .
This and other temples thus formed easily the pattern for the living art of the modern sthapati or temple - builder of south India .
Such work can be seen in the rock fort temple at Tiruchirapalli , Madurai , and other places .
The entire temple complex inside the Vellore fort including the kalayana - mandapa and gopura , as also much of the Virinchipuram temple near Vellore , is the work of the Bommi Nayakas of Vellore , What we see , however , of temples or their ruins inside the extensive fort at Gingee and its neighbourhood is the creation of Gingee Nayakas .
Similarly , there are many small Nayaka temples inside the Chandragiri fort .
There are a few granite stone - built temples of the Hoysala times , built when a collateral branch of the dynasty ruled over parts of Tamil Nadu with the capital at Kannanur near Srirangam and Jambuk - esvaram .
They are all built in the local regional style in logical continuation of the late Pandya temples of Tamil Nadu and consequently heralding features of the Vijayanagar temples of Tamil Nadu that followed .
Such temples of the Hoysala times are to be found in Kannanur , some 6 kms from Srirangam ( Posalesvara , called locally Bhojesvara ) and in Jambukesvaram , in the eastern part of the Srirangam island .
There are a few more constructed by the Hoysala generals and administrators , in the Tiruchirapalli and Pudukkottai districts , for example the temple unit at Sembattur ( Pudukkottai ) .
These temples built during the Hoysala interregnum reveal in their architecture and sculpture only the local regional norms , and not of the Hoysala patterns as known in their home country ( Karnataka ) built of soft soapstone .
The Srirangam Venugopala temple shows noticeably far advanced architectural and sculptural features of the local regional style .
The sculpture of the tall , slender - built graceful maidens , perhaps many of them depicting gopis , besides salabhanjikas in different attitudes and poses , contrast with the short - built and buxom madanikas , of Belur , Halebid and similar feminine sculpture in other centres of Hoysala art .
The Venugopala temple sculptures may bear comparison , if one is at all required , with the similar hardstone caryatid ( madanika ) sculptures of the Kakatiyas and , nearer home , with those at Krishnapuram and Tenkasi ( Tkunelveli district ) and in the Pudu mandapam and other parts of the Madurai - Minakshi - Sundaresvara temple .
The Ikkeri Nayakas have left temples of a Chalukyan affiliation in their capital towns of Ikkeri , Keladi , and in other places in their area .
The Aghoresvara temple at Ikkeri ( Shimoga district ) is the largest and finest of the Ikkeri style of temples .
It will be evident that this system of tiered arrangement of slopy roof slabs or cornices curved one over the other was best suited to a region of high rainfall , as was the original Kadamba region on the west coast .
It may be said that this form with either type of top member and devoid of or with the sukanasika is more or less a cross between the typical northern prasada superstructure and the southern vim ' ana form .
This type is exemplified by the Mallikarjuna group ( c . eighth century ) near the Galaganatha temple at Aihole , the Lakulisa temple on the way to the bhutanatha group in the Badami valley and in the Mahakutesvar group , all of the Badami - Chalukya - Rashtrakuta origin .
The group of smaller shrines behind the Mahanandisvara temple complex at Mahanandi ( Kurnool district ) , and the Papanasanam group of temples in Alampur , are of this type in the Eastern Chalukyan territory .
Eight of the nine structures of the Lakshmi Devi temple complex in Doddagaddavalli ( Hassan district , Mysore ) built in 1113 are of this type belonging to the Hoysala period .
In the Eastern Chalukyan area comprising the district of Kurnool , Mahboobnagar and Guntur , we have such rekha - prasada - type temples built from the seventh - eighth centuries .
In the navabrahma complex of nine temples in Alampur , all except the tarakabrahma , which is of the southern vimana type , are of this variety .
They mostly date earlier than AD 713 when , as stated in an inscription , the prakara enclosing the whole group was built by Isanacharya .
They are mostly nirandhara while a few are sandhara .
Each unit consists of a sanctum with a well - proportioned tri ratha sikhara , an antarala and pillared mandapa with a two - tiered flat roof .
The whole axial series has a single entrance in front and a continuous wall surrounding it , forming also the outer wall of the cell in the sandhara type .
The exterior wall faces are richly carved with niches , surmounted by udgama motifs containing fine sculptures and lattice windows .
The carvings are fine , and reminiscent of the central Indian and Rajasthani styles .
The Balabrahma is the most advanced and elaborate specimen of the group .
Most of these temples , some with original foundations dating from the tenth - eleventh centuries , have been considerably renovated and reconstructed in their upper parts in recent centuries and as a result do not reveal much that can be attributed to or interpreted as evolutionary trends .
Usually what goes unnoticed is the internal make - up and structural contents of the srikoyil , since , by ritual , tradition and convention , the interior of the Kerala temple is totally inaccessible to any except the ordinated priesthood .
What one perceives of the srikoyil is in fact an external shell , as it were , of a core vimana or garbhakudya inside .
The internal core containing the garbha or sanctum is in essentials a vimana form as found elsewhere in the south , often with a full complement of its angas in the tiered superstructure over the cella , including the crest or sikhara , or more commonly ending up with its griva ; in either case the superstructure is raised up over the cella by the system of internal corbelling or kadalika karana .
The plan of this nuclear unit often does not correspond with the ground plan of the srikoyil and its plinth and it is usual to find that the cella is square , inside what is externally a circular or apsidal structure or vice versa .
The ultimate external conical ( domical ) or ridged roof either covers the inner sikhara over the nuclear inner structure like an umbrella with its stupi or it is made to rest on the top of the griva itself , forming sikhara with stupi as common to both .
While , essentially , the nuclear fane or the sanctum sanctorum is of the usual vimana type as found developed in the mainland part east of the Western Ghats , the outer srikoyil structure is an adaptation to form a protective armour , so to say , shielding the inner core from the excessive and continuous monsoon precipitation of the western littoral , much like an umbrella single - or multiple - tieredor a shell .
He is not afraid of pain any longer .
It is fear that distorts the truth . " Far as I gaze at the depth of Thy immensity , I find no trace there of sorrow or death or separation .
This volume of one hundred poems appropriately entitled " Offering " was dedicated by the author to his venerable eighty - three year old fatherin grateful acknowledgement of his debt to him , for the spiritual and moral wealth enshrined in its pages was in a sense the Maharshi ' s gift to him .
When he read out these poems in manuscript to his father , the latter was so pleased that he gave his son a purse to meet the expenses of publication of the volume .
For even in his other worldly and God - conscious moods , Rabindranath could not and would not avert his face from this life and earth .
" I feel the embrace of freedom in a thousand bonds of delight . " Love of God and love of life went hand in hand in him and vindicated and fulfilled one another . Hymns to the divine were also prayers for his people , as in the well - known poem , " Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high . . . "
But Bahadur Shah had neither the guts , nor the power , nor the will left to say anything .
The first question that arises on this trial is whether under the rules of International Law , it is possible to try a king like a common man , there is no doubt that Bahadur Shah was a King and was recognised as such .
The Britishers , prior to 1857 , were no sovereign rulers of India and Bahadur Shah was not their subject , though he was awarded a pension .
During the war of independence , in 1857 , a stage came when Delhi became de jure and de facto independent of the Company ' s rule and Bahadur Shah was declared as King Emperor .
In such circumstances , it can be said that trying Bahadur Shah as a traitor , was not proper according to law and finds no justification anywhere .
Though according to law of evidence , the prosecutor placed before the court enough material to prove the charge , it remained legally untested as Bahadur Shah was in no position to cross - examine or defend himself , nor was he provided any legal aid .
The conditions in the country were such at the time that no one , having any legal knowldege , had the courage to come forward to defend Bahadur Shah .
The verdict cannot be termed as a judicial verdict after hearing both the parties .
The manner in which Bahadur Shah was brought to Delhi after the defeat and the way the evidence was recorded , leaves no doubt that the whole trial was a farce .
Bahadur Shah , a sovereign , should not have been tried at all .
Moreover , he was not in a mental state to face such a trial and defend himself effectively .
He was 82 - years - old .
Every friend and follower , including his wife , Zeenat Mahal , had almost deserted him .
The trial lasted more than two months .
At no stage was there any doubt about the verdict .
On the 29th of March , 1858 , Bahadur Shah was found guilty of all the charges and . subsequently sentenced to be transported for life to Rangoon .
He left Delhi in October , 1858 accompanied by Jawan Bakht , another young son he had by a concubine , and by a most unwilling Zeenat Mahal , who , by now " quite tired of him " , described him as " a troublesome , nasty , crass old fellow " .
He died on 7th November , 1862 in Rangoon .
Not only was the grievous wrong not redressed , he was not even permitted to enrol himself as a barrister .
On his return to India in June , 1875 , Surendra Nath began afresh as a Professor of English , first in the Metropolitan Institution , then in the Free Church College and later in the . college founded by him and named Ripon College ( now known as Surendra Nath College ) .
During his teaching lessons as well as public lectures , he fired his listeners with a new zeal by talking at length on the life and teachings of J . Mazzini , on the life history of Shivaji , and the Sikhs , etc .
He founded , on 26th July , 1876 , the Indian Association which was intended to be the centre of an all - Indian political movement .
He undertook tours all over India to awaken the spirit of unity and solidarity among the people .
Surendra Nath ' s popularity can fee gauged from the fact that there was a total " hartal ' in Bengal when he was sentenced to imprisonment on the charge of contempt of court for remarks made by him in his paper , ' The Bengalee ' , against the Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court for ordering a Hindu to produce the image of his household deity in the court .
Surendra Nath played a leading role in the Indian National Congress too , and twice became its president in 1895 and 1902 .
It is undoubtedly due to the part played by Surendra Nath and his colleagues in Bengal that the Indian National Congress came to be looked upon , after the second session , as the handiwork of the Bengalis .
He took part in the agitation against the partition of Bengal in 1905 and in the subsequent ' Swadeshi ' and ' Boycott ' movements .
His leadership at the Barisal Conference made him the ' uncrowned king of Bengal ' .
He was a frank and fearless man and for his undaunted courage was imprisoned for contempt of the High Court .
He spoke against corrupt judiciary and set an example for times to come and paved the way for the right of freedom of expression .
Surendra Nath Banerjea was editor of an English newspaper in which he wrote a leading article on 28th April , 1883 .
This article was based on the report published in Brahmo Public Opinion stating that one of the judges of the High Court of Calcutta , Mr Justice Norris , had ordered a Hindu litigant to bring his household deity ( Saligram ) for identifiction in the court .
It seems that on previous occasions also , Justice Norris had acted with prejudice against the Indians while deciding cases .
Such a report enraged the feelings of a large section of the Indian population in Bengal and Surendra Nath Banerjea , Who was known for his fearlessness and courage , wrote an article severely castigating the conduct of the judge .
He wrote : This article created a stir not only in Bengal but all over India , offending the sentiments of Hindus besides angering the judiciary , particularly the English judges .
The language of the article was strident and censorious .
It was a frontal attack on judiciary and more particularly . upon a sitting English judge of the High Court .
" I say most emphatically , that if I had known or had any reason to believe , that the statements of the Bmhmo Public Opinion a foresaid were in any respect inaccurate , I would not have made the observations I have , and I am truly sorry that I was misled into making them , and I withdraw them unreservedly ; but I repeat that my observations were made perfectly bona fide , and without any motive of any description whatsoever other than the motive to promote public good .
" That the circumstances of British India are such , that this hon ' ble court and the other High Courts in the other presidencies are looked upon , and I believe justly looked upon , as the staunchest , the most upright and the most impartial upholders of the just rights and privileges of all sections of the community , and any action on the part of any hon ' ble and learned judge of these hon ' ble courts tending to show the least disregard of such rights and privileges is viewed with great alarm by the community , and I conceive that it is the duty of all journalists to maintain that no such disregard is shown . "
Challenging the jurisdiction of the High Court in issuing the notice , he submitted : " That I am advised , that this hon ' ble court has no jurisdiction to issue the said rule , or to deal with me or the said Ramcoomar Dey summarily ; but the question , I am also advised , is one of extreme difficulty , and I know it to be one of great public importance , and one which will require much time and attention to be dealt with as , in my judgment , it should be dealt with . "
He had the courage to say that a case like his could not be tried summarily .
Though he had tendered an apology and wanted time , no time was granted and the case was taken up on 4 / 5 May , 1883 before the Chief Justice and four judges of the High Court , viz .
Garth , The Chief Justice with whom Cunningham J . , McDonell J . , and Norris J . concurred , delivered the verdict of the court , shows how sensitive were English judges and how harsh they were in such cases .
The case was taken up on 4th May , 1883 and the judgment was delivered the next day .
Your counsel , though invited to do so , has wholly failed to explain to the satisfaction of the court why that article was inserted .
And you must have known perfectly well that the affidavits , upon which the rule was issued , were not directed to the subject of that article .
" These matters in your affidavit , so far from extenuating your offence , appear to the court to be an aggravation of it .
" The judges are at a loss to understand how a libel so gross could possibly have been inserted in your paper in good faith ' and they find great difficulty in believing that a gentleman of your education , and a newspaper editor , could be so utterly ignorant of the law of libel as to suppose that you were at liberty to publish these attacks upon the conduct and character of a High Court judge , merely because you found them , though in a less virulent form , in another native newspaper .
" The court is quite willing to make some allowance for your affidavit having been drawn , as your counsel informed us was the case , in a hurry and without consideration . But they cannot look upon it , for the reasons which I have just mentioned , as any extenuation of your offence . To admonish Surendra Nath Banerjea , the Chief Justice awarded the following sentence :
" We feel that it is absolutely necessary to vindicate and maintain the authority of the court and to guard against the repetition of the grave offence which you have committed , by imposing upon you not a fine , ( which in your case would be mere nominal penalty ) , but such a substantial punishment as may serve as a wholesome warning to yourself and others .
The court order is that you be imprisoned on the civil side of Presidency Jail for the space of two months . "
In the history of British judiciary in India it was for the first time such a severe sentence was imposed on a public man for contempt of the court , who had fully explained the position and expressed regrets .
It was an accepted practice , though not a rule , that whenever the contemner offered unconditional apology , he would be generally admonished and no jail sentence would be awarded unless the contemner remained unrelented or the nature of the offence was such as a fine would not be sufficient punishment .
In the guise of semblance of justice , the High Court was keen to teach a lesson not only to Surendra Nath Banerjea but to warn Indians in general that it would not allow any criticism of a British judge .
But after giving my best consideration to the question of the punishment that should be inflicted , I am unable to agree with the view of the majority of the court .
There have been in this court two cases of a similar nature since its establishment .
The matter was discussed fully , and after the court had pronounced its decision that they were guilty , suitable apologies were made .
" In the case before us , the persons charged with contempt have at once admitted their guilt , and have expressed their deep regret at having unwittingly cast an undeserved slur upon a learned judge of this court .
" In the first mentioned case , Sir Barnes Peacock , C . J . , in delivering the judgment , said : ' Although the majority of the judges were of the opinion that both these gentlemen , i . e . the persons charged with contempt , had acted in contempt of court , they did not wish to visit the offence with any punishment .
" In the other case the sentence of the court was that Mr Taylor should stand committed for one month to the civil side of the Presidency Jail , and that he should pay a fine of Rs 500 and that he should be further imprisoned till the fine was paid .
There Sir Barnes Peacock , C . J . , referring to an apology which had been published by Mr Taylor before this sentence was passed , said , lf you think fit to add to the apology which you have already published ( and it is for you to decide whether you can conscientiously do so of not ) , the court is willing to mitigate the sentence .
Tilak was tried and convicted for sedition by an English jury after three weeks of prolonged trial in the Bombay High Court wherein he led his own defence .
The immortal words with which he greeted his conviction are now enshrined in a tablet in the Central Room of the Bombay High Court where he was tried and convicted .
He said , " All I wish to say is that inspite of the verdict of the jury , I maintain that I am innocent .
There are higher ^ powers that rule the destiny of things , and , it may be the will of Providence that the cause I represent may prosper more by my suffering than by my remaining free . "
In the annals of Indian legal trials , no other trial has its parallel .
Unveiling the tablet at the Central Hall of the High Court at Bombay , the then Chief Justice of Bombay , Mr M . C . Chagla , said : " There is no honour and no distinction which I have valued more than the privilege of being able to unveil the tablet to Lokmanya Tilak ' s memory this morning .
In this very room on two occasions within the space of twelve years , Lokmanya Tilak sat in the dock as an accused ; and on two occasions he was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment .
We have met here today to make atonement for the suffering that was caused by these convictions to a great and distinguished son of India .
That disgrace tarnished our record and we are here to remove that tarnish and that disgrace .
With scant knowledge of Marathi , he remarked that the accused had referred to the English rule in India as the country ' s misfortune and had suggested that bombs and murders would help India to secure political rights as had happened elsewhere .
He did his best to prejudice the minds of the special jury , who themselves had no knowledge of Marathi .
In support of the charge under Section 153 - A , he read the article from the Kesari .
The gist of the article published on 12th May , as given by the prosecutor , may be quoted here :
" All thoughtful people , seem now to have formed the opinion as to the cause that gave birth to the ' bomb party ' .
The ' bomb party ' has come into existence as a result of oppression practised by the official class , the harassment inflicted by them and their obstinacy in treating public opinion with recklessness .
The bomb exploded owing to the official class having tried the patience of the Bengali youth .
The responsibility of the calamity must , therefore , be thrown not on political agitation , writing , or speeches but on the thoughtlessness and the obstinacy of the official class . "
The price was heavy , for he won the support neither of the orthodox who looked askance at him as an impertinent innovator nor of the radicals who were alienated by his harping on the past .
He had to stand alone a position ideal for a poet but inconvenient for a social reformer who needed money and men for his institution .
Even his admirers and well - wishers were inclined to believe that die school was at best a poet ' s whim .
He found it difficult to get enough funds or enough pupils for his school , and had to sell his house at Puri and part of his personal library to meet the expenses , while his wife magnificently parted with her jewellery to help him carry on .
The school , however , was not a poet ' s whim .
It was his new sadhana , a medium of creative striving for the good of his people , his one epic which he continued to work on till the end of his life and which grew with his growth , remaining unfinished .
A poet ' s dream it undoubtedly was , for who but a poet could " bring the earliest tidings of the unborn flower to a sceptic would ? "
He had always been deeply interested in problems affecting the welfare of the people and of such problems none seamed more deserving of his attention than the prevailing system of education which , instead of developing , stunted the mind of the growing generation .
That is a burden which the defence cannot be made to bear .
It is for the prosecution to prove that the translation is correct .
Here the charge is based on the English translation and not on the driginal Marathi article .
Supposing this was an English article and supposing an Englishman were charged with sedition , the charge would fail if the prosecution proceeded on a document in which it was proved different words to those written were inserted .
Here there are differences between the original words in Marathi in the Kesari and the words used in the translations . "
Tilak submitted that a healthy criticism of administration was a part of his duty as a public worker and a journalist .
It was the duty of every Indian .
It was a brilliant 22 - hour defence by Tilak , spread over six days .
He explained that the Kesari articles were meant to warn the government that a policy of repression was not correct .
Even if you do not agree , you are entitled to say that in your opinion the matter does not come under Section 124 - A .
You may agree or not with me , you may accept my views or not accept my views .
The point is whether I was within my rights and whether a subject of His Majesty in India can or cannot enjoy the same freedom which is enjoyed by British subjects at home , and the Anglo - Indians out here .
It is not a matter of whether the views are correct .
I may , who knows , alter my views .
Gentlemen , come to your views .
You will presently hear what the Advocate General has to say and after him His Lordship will address you .
The responsibility is yours ; you will have to return a verdict of ' guilty ' or ' not guilty ' .
Coming from the people and knowing their sentiments and thoughts you will have to say what you think would be the effect .
I would ask you to forget all other circumstances outside this court .
No less important , said Tagore , is the influence of music and of the fine arts in training the child ' s emotions and his sensibility .
Education to be real must be of the whole man , of the emotions and the senses as much as of the intellect .
Man in his fullness , said Tagore , is not limited by the individual but overflows in his community .
And so in his school , along with training in individual initiative and self - reliance , equal emphasis was laid on community service .
If it does not strike roots in the soil and adapt itself to the natural environments , it has little value for the people as a whole .
It was painful and humiliating fact that the intelligentsia of that generation to some extent even of this were borrowing their patterns of thought and behaviour , indeed even of their feelings and sensations , from the West , thereby justifying Tagore ' s charge that " educational institutions in our country are India ' s alms - bowl of knowledge ; they lower our national self - respect ; they encourage us to make a foolish display of decorations made of borrowed feathers . "
Life never imitates , it assimilates , and so he warned his people that " if the whole world grows at last into an exaggerated west , then such an illimitable parody of the modern age will die , crushed beneath its own absurdity . "
These were , the main principles of his educational ideal which he tried - to implement with his very limited material resources and in a very humble beginning .
It was not that having established the school , he left it to his assistants to run it , himself occupied with higher things .
He loved children , loved being with them , and loved teaching them .
It was his faith that every child carried a message from God that He had not yet despaired of man .
Finding that there were no suitable primers and textbooks available in Bengali he wrote them himself and encouraged his colleagues to do the same .
The poet could drudge as well as sing .
As though to test the sincerity and strength of His new devotee , God sent him , as He had done to His servant Job of the Old Testament , a series of bereavements and afflictions .
Within a few months of his finding a new home in Santiniketan , his wife Mrinalini fell seriously ill and was taken to Calcutta where she died on 23 November 1902 .
For twenty years this lady , self - effacing and gracious , had looked after him with unstinted devotion and had borne him five children .
These were published in a small volume of twenty - seven poems remarkable for their depth of tender ness and for their simplicity of utterance .
" My night has passed on the bed of sorrow , and my eyes are tired . "
She died before he could repay for the many gifts he had received from her and now all he could do is to offer to God what was meant for her .
" Her night has found its morning and Thou hast taken her in Thy arms ; and to Thee I bring my gratitude and my gifts that were for her . "
Absent - mindedly he looks for her everywhere in the house , only to realise that he will never again see her on this earth . " My house is small and what once has gone from it can never be regained .
But infinite is Thy mansion , my Lord , and seeking her I have come to Thy door . "
The volume was published a year later as Smaran ( Remembrance ) .
Grief disguised is more potent than grief expressed .
And looking round at the host of familiar faces of men and women who had travelled far to offer him a token of their love , he added , This is like a family gathering and not a law court ' . " ,
The Sessions Judge charged them as follows : " That you , Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi , being the editor of the paper Young India , on or about the 29th day of September , 1921 , the 15th day of December , 1921 and the 23rd day of February , 1922 at Ahmedabad did write the words contained in the appendix to this charge and by these written words did bring or attempt to bring into hatred or contempt or did excite or did attempt to excite disaffection towards His Majesty or the government established by law in British India and you , Shankerlal Ghelabhai Banker , being the printer of the paper Young India , on or about the 29th day of September , 1921 , the 15th day of December , 1921 and the 23rd day of February , 1922 at Ahmedabad did print the words contained in the appendix to this charge and by these written words did bring or attempt to bring into hatred or contempt or did excite or attempted to excite disaffection towards His Majesty or the government established by law in British India and thereby you committed offence punishable under Section 124 - A of the Indian Penal Code and within the cognisance of thi
When the court called upon the accused to state if they plead guilty , Gandhi said : " I plead guilty on each count of the charge .
I merely observe that the King ' s name is omitted from the charge - sheet and in my opinion very properly . "
The Advocate General ( Sir T . Strangman , special public prosecutor ) asked the court not to convict on the pleas but to proceed with the trial .
However , the court accepted the pleas of the ' guilty ' and asked the public prosecutor to say anything he wished to say on the question of sentence .
Sir T . Strangman submitted as follows :
" I maintain that the articles contained in the charge are part of an organised campaign which has lasted for years .
Secondly , Mr Gandhi is an educated man and a recognised leader and this makes the campaign all the more harmful .
The court must consider the inevitable result of this campaign as shown by recent events .
The offence of the second accused is of less gravity but nonetheless serious .
In this case there should be a substantial fine . "
Gandhi , when asked to say anything he wished to say , uttered these memorable words : " Before reading my " Preaching disaffection , I admit , has become a passion with me and it commenced long before the time mentioned by him .
I admit the blame for the crimes of violence committed in Bombay , Madras and elsewhere .
It is true that I ought to know the consequences of my acts .
I admit that I have been playing with fire , but should do so again if released .
I feel it necessary that I should do this as my duty to my people .
I do not ask for any mercy .
The court must do its duty .
The enobling confessions , the convincing logic , the masterly diction , the elevated thoughts and the inspiring tone , all produced instantaneous effect on the audience including the judge and the prosecutor .
For a minute everybody wondered who was on trial - whether Gandhiji before a British judge or whether the British Government before God and humanity .
Mahatmaji finished reading his statement and for a few seconds there was complete silence in the hall .
The Advocate General then pointed out that , under Section 27 - B of Criminal Procedure Code , the court might convict the accused on their pleas or proceed with the trial .
Section 124 - A says : " If the accused plead ' guilt , the plea shall be recorded , and he may be convicted thereon . "
Thus it was necessary for the judge to proceed with the case , firstly , because the charges were of a serious character , and secondly , in public interest it was desirable that the charges should be fully investigated .
As regards the question of sentence , once Gandhi had pleaded ' guilty ' , the judge could pass sentence . But , before that he wanted to hear the Advocate General , who pointed out that the articles by the accused were not isolated . They formed part of an organised campaign launched through " Young India since the year 1921 .
The court then read extracts from the paper , dated 8th June , on the duty of a non - co - operator , which was to preach disaffection towards the existing government and prepare the country for civil disobedience .
I have to deal with you in one character only .
It is my duty to ' judge ' you as a man subject to the law who has , by his own admission , broken the law and committed what to an ordinary man must appear to be grave offences against the State .
There are , probably , few people in India who do not sincerely regret that you should have made it impossible for any government to leave you at liberty .
I am trying to balance what is due to you against what appears to me to be necessary in the interests of the public .
And I propose in passing sentence to follow the precedent of a case , in many respects similar to this case , that was decided some twelve years ago .
The sentence that was passed upon him , as it finally stood , was a sentence of simple imprisonment for six years .
And I should like to say in doing so that if the course of events in India should make it possible for the government to reduce the period and release you , no one would be better pleased than I . "
Again in words of Justice Shelat : " Why has the trial been acknowledged to be a great historic trial out shadowing all similar trials of leaders and patriots which preceded it ?
Surely not merely because of the personality of the accused , nor because of his extraordinary sway on the millions and millions of Indians whom he treated as his own , nor because of its consequences on the destiny of India , but , because of the profound issue involved in it that of obedience of laws as against obedience to moral duty .
It was that issue which elevated the trial to the highest plane and the characters too , who played their part in it .
And , though it was similar to the one raised in previous trials of the same nature , those of Coke and Hampden and other patriots who had fought against tyranny and despotism , it was far above them because of the spiritual premises discovered as a result of a lifetime search for and experiments with truth on which it rested . "
It was a trial in the history of criminal trials in India where not a single pie was spent for by the defendant for defence .
There was no defence counsel , no legal advice , but the accused earned eternal glory in India ' s moral and legal firmament .
S . A . Dange The Meerut conspiracy case trial was one of the most notorious trials to take place during the British regime .
Thirty - two communists were involved in the conspiracy and all except Hutch - inson , a British subject , and M . N . Roy were arrested in March , 1929 and kept in jail custody throughout the trial .
They were charged under Section 121 - A of the Indian Penal Code .
The trial become notorious on account of its uprecedented duration .
Students were being expelled from colleges for no other crime than the temerity to sing patriotic songs ; to provide for their education he and some other educationists formulated and put into operation a scheme for national education and set up a Council of which the celebrated philosopher - yogi , Aurobindo Ghosh , became the first Principal .
It was for this Council that Tagore delivered his well - known series of lectures on the principles of literature which were later published as Sahitya .
He had hoped that by leading the popular discontent against foreign rule he would succeed in yoking the newly aroused passion for national freedom to a dynamic programme of national regeneration .
He had planned and outlined such a programme in a series of remarkable lectures and essays in which he anticipated almost every basic principle of what later became a nation - wide mass movement of non - violent non - cooperation under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi .
He lacked the Mahatma ' s tireless patience and persistence , his calm judgement and unruffled will , his genius for strategy and his unrivalled gift of leadership .
He rode the storm majestically for a time , but as soon as it raised in its inevitable howl of violence , he retired from the battle - field , a sadder and a wiser man .
He was severely criticised for having abandoned the struggle which he had so heroically inspired , but be it recalled to Tagore ' s credit that he knew his limitations an4 wisely refrained from persisting in a course which he was unable to direct , that he was not deflected from what he thought was right by public abuse .
Apart from a large number of articles on social and national problems , on education , literary criticism , folk literature and the philosophy of words and sounds , he wrote a number of humorous and satirical sketches and completed his next major volume of verse published in 1906 as Kheya ( Crossing ) .
The tide is symbolic of the poet ' s mood of wistful expectancy , of waiting for the ferry to cross over to the other bank .
The trial in the Sessions Court started in the first week of June , 1929 .
The public prosecutor who conducted the case for the Crown produced few more witnesses on behalf of the prosecution .
Once the prosecution evidence had been completed , Bhagat Singh felt that the stage had been reached when he should make a detailed statement on behalf of their cause .
He had worked hard to prepare his written statement himself .
That historic statement was read out to the court by Asaf Ali on behalf of Bhagat Singh and Dutt on 6th June .
The statement forms a glorious chapter in the history of revolutionary ideas in India and is a masterly piece of a document based on revolutionary and Marxian principles .
The statement was so touching that three of the four assessors could not hide their eyes dimmed with tears .
Is the charge , as framed by the lower court , correct or otherwise ?
" To the first half of the first question , our reply is in the affirmative but since some of the so - called eye witnesses ' have prejured themselves and since we are not denying our liability to that extent , let our statement about them be judged for what it is worth .
The other witnesses , too , who have deposed to having seen bombs being thrown by us have no scruples to tell lies .
" The bomb was necessary to awaken England from her dreams .
We dropped the bomb on the floor of the Assembly chamber to register our protest on behalf of those who had no other means left to give expression to their heart - rending agony .
Our sole purpose was to make the deaf hear and give the heedless a timely warning .
Others have as keenly felt as we have done and from such seeming stillness of the sea of Indian humanity , a veritable storm is about to break out .
We have only hoisted the " Danger Signal ' to warn those who are speeding along without heeding to the grave dangers ahead .
We have only marked the end of an era of Utopian non - violence of whose futility the rising generation has been convinced beyond the shadow of doubt . "
On the contrary , we repeat that we hold human lives sacred beyond words and would sooner lay down our own lives in the service of humanity than injure anyone else . "
Explaining the concept of revolution the statement read : " It was the only effective method of solving the great social problems of the timesthe problem of bringing economic and political independence to the workers and peasants , constituting the mass of the people . "
The many bereavements and disappointments he had recently suffered had only served to steel his fortitude and to prepare him for the change that was coming .
Most of the poems ( some are songs ) are dreamy and symbolic ; eleven of them were later included in his English Gitanjali , and a few others in The Gardener , Fruit Gathering and Lover ' s Gift and Crossing .
" Prisoner , tell me who wrought this unbreakable chain ? "
" It was I , " said the prisoner , " who forged this chain with great care .
I thought my chain would bind the world leaving me free .
And so I laboured at it , day and night , beating the iron in fire .
When the chain was ready , I discovered that I had bound myself in its shackles . "
The poet describes himself as a beggar girl who was on her begging round when the Prince stopped before her and stretching his hand , said , " Give me something . "
She blushed with shame .
What could she give him ?
Kundan Lal and Prem Dutt were awarded imprisonment for seven and five years respectively .
Ajoy Ghosh , J . N . Sanyal and Des Raj were acquitted .
Of those absconding , Bhagwati Charan met with an accident in a bomb explosion in May , 1930 and Chandra Shekhar Azad was killed in an encounter with the police in Azad Park , Allahabad in February , 1931 .
The legal battle was not over even after the death sentence .
The defence council composed of prominent public men decied to file a petition to the Privy Council to challenge firstly , the legality of the ordinance appointing a Special Tribunal and secondly to disseminate knowledge and give publicity abroad of India ' s struggle for freedom .
On 10th February , 1931 , the petition was rejected by the Privy Council .
Not to be deterred , on the 14th of February , 1931 , Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya submitted an appeal to the Viceroy seeking his prerogative of mercy in commuting death sentence to transportation for life on the grounds of humanity .
On 16th February , 1931 , Messers Jiwan Lal , Baljit and Sham Lal moved a writ of habeas corpus in the High Court challenging the legality of their detention and proposed execution of the death - sentence on the ground that the original date of execution ( sometime in October , 1930 ) having passed , the Tribunal had ceased to exist .
It further united the freedom fighters in their struggle against the British .
It was decided by the government that the execution of the sentence would take place on 23rd March , 1931 .
After release , he joined the Indian National Congress .
On the controversial issue of the Indian National Congress helping the British Government in the Second World War , he resigned .
I was attracted to him because he seemed such a lonely figure , deserted by everybody .
On 10th May , 1924 , i . e . after the arguments in the Sessions trial were concluded and before the judgment was pronounced in the Kanpur case , Lieutenant - Colonel Cecil Kaye , counsel for the prosecution , requested the District Magistrate to issue warrants for the arrest of M . N . Roy .
The warrant was issued and made over to Cecil Kaye .
It was presumed that it would be sent to England for execution as Roy , according to Scotland Yard ' s information , was likely to go to England and the continent .
M . N . Roy returned to India secretly in December , 1930 .
Roy , during the Sessions trial , wanted to make a lengthy statement in his defence , but was not allowed to make it .
It was later smuggled out from jail and published under the title ' MY DEFENCE ' .
It is a remarkable legal document which has established its place in legal history .
It gives ample proof of industry , intelligence and the wide knowledge of M . N . Roy .
He then made submission under Section 121 - A of the Indian Penal Code penalising a conspiracy to deprive the King of his sovereignty of India and disputed its legality and constitutionality .
He stated that the British Government of India has been a machine of ' an enormous tyranny and oppression ' , that ' the people of India owe no allegiance to the British Crown ' and that they have the right to revolt .
He supported his arguments from the quotations of Locke , Hume , Bentham , Bagehot , Dicey and other political philosophers and legal experts who wrote about the legality of the British conquest of India .
Replying to the accusation of the intention to use ' criminal ' force , he stated :
" But in reality force is force .
Judgment was reserved until 9th January , 1932 when Roy was sentenced to 12 years ' transportation .
Immediately plans were made for appeal to the High Court and to the Privy Council , if necessary .
Since all of Roy ' s friends , except Brajesh Singh , lived in other parts of the country , Brajesh Singh was given the sole responsibility for making arrangements for the appeal . Unfortunately for Roy , several months before the appeal was to be heard , Brajesh Singh renounced Roy ' s doctrines and returned to the orthodox communist fold .
By the end of 1932 , he had returned to Europe .
With Singh ' s sudden departure , Roy was crippled in his effort to prepare for the hearing of his appeal .
It proved difficult to assemble the papers of the case , which had been in Singh ' s care .
Most of Roy ' s loyal supporters as well many left - wing nationalists , who had come to his defence , were in jail .
The appeal was heard and decided on 2nd May , 1933 by Thomas , J . It was argued by young and able Dr K . N . Katju assisted by Mr D . Sanyal , whereas the government advocate appeared for the Crown .
The institution of such a communist regime was to be preceded by the violent overthrow of the existing Constitution in India and the destruction of the sovereignty of the King Emperor .
His youngest son , Samindra , a lovely and gifted boy who might have become something like his father , suddenly died of cholera at the age of thirteen , on the same day on which his mother had passed away five years earlier .
In the course of five tempestuous years Tagore suffered an almost total break - up of his family life .
He had lost his wife and two children ; of the three surviving ones , the eldest daughter lived with her husband outside Bengal , the eldest son had been sent to the United States the previous year for training in agricultural science , and the third daughter Mira had been married a few months earlier .
Loneliness in the midst of the crowd is even more oppressive and so for a time he retired into solitude on his estate at Shelidah .
That was the only visible expression of the heavy hand of sorrow that lay on his heart .
He had learnt not to muddy the waters of his Muse with his personal grief ; his verse was becoming increasingly his offering to God , the medium of a higher love , shorn of all superfluous ornaments .
Indeed , odd and incredible as it may seem today , even as late as 1914 ( after the award of the Nobel Prize ) the Compulsory Bengali Composition Paper of the Matriculation Exam of the Calcutta University contained a passage from Tagore which the candidates were asked to " rewrite in chaste and correct Bengali . "
The only time he rode on the crest of popularity was when he led the agitation against the partition of Bengal , but that was for a brief while only and now he was blamed for having let down his people and was less popular than ever .
He had alienated the ruling authorities who issued secret circulars asking the Government servants and loyalists not to send their children to his school or help it in any way .
" Seventh charge : I . A . A . Section 41 ( against the said Captain P . K . Sehgal alone ) .
Committing a civil offence , that is to say , abetment contrary to Section 109 , I . P . C . of an offence punishable under Section 302 , I . P . C . in that he ( Capt . Sehgal ) at or near Popa Hill , on or about 6th March , 1945 , did abet the offence of the murder of Dar - yao Singh , as specified in the sixth charge hereof , which offence was committed in consequence of such abetment .
" Eight Charge : I . A . A . Section 41 ( against the said Lt . Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon alone ) .
Committing a civil offence , that is to say , murder contrary to Section 302 , I . P . C . in that he ( Lt . Dhillon ) at or Popa Hill in Burma , on or near about 6th March , 1945 , by causing the death of Dharam Singh , did commit murder .
" Ninth Charge : I . A : A . Section 41 ( against the said Captain P . K Sehgal alone ) .
Committing a civil offence , that is to say , abetment , contrary to Section 109 , I . P . C . , of an offence punishable under Section 302 , I . P . C . , in that he ( Capt . Sehgal ) at or near Popa Hill , on or about 6th March , 1945 , did abet the offence of the murder of Dharam Singh , as specified in eighth charge hereof , which offence was committed in consequence of such abetment .
" Tenth Charge : I . A . A . Section 41 ( against the said Captain Shah Nawaz Khan alone ) .
Sir N . P . Engineer , opening the prosecution case , said that the accused were Indian commissioned officers owing allegiance to the King and as such they were subject to the Army Act .
Tracing the history of the formation of the Indian National Army ( I . N . A . ) , he said that Subhas Chandra Bose had left India in January , 1942 for Kabul from where he had proceeded to Germany via Moscow .
He was a political suspect and was under watch .
He was thus forced , as much by outer circumstances as by an inner necessity , to stand alone , to rely entirely on his inner resources , to stand face to face with God .
His religious poetry of this period which culminated in the passionate sincerity and utter simplicity of Gitanjali and Gitimalya was wrung out of his heart ' s blood .
His religious insight , like that of all great saints and mystics , was born of deeply experienced sorrow and loneliness .
The most remarkable aspect of his deepening religious insight was that it enriched instead of eating into or warping his love of this earth and this life .
He sought God not merely in the privacy of his soul but in every manifestation of His play in the outside world .
It is still a favourite with the boys of his school for whom itwas composed and is acted in the open air , as many of Tagore ' s plays were intended to be , for in them nature is not merely a background but almost a participant .
They were Across - examined by the defence counsel and thereafter the statements of all the three accused were recorded .
Capt . Shah Nawaz Khan questioned the authority of the court to try him .
In his statement he explained how and why he joined the Indian National Army .
He said , " In short , the question before me was the King or the country .
I decided to be loyal to my country and gave my word of honour to Netaji that I would sacrifice myself for her sake .
Finally , Sir , I wish to bring to your notice and to the notice of my country that no mercenary or puppet army could have faced the hardships as the I . N . A . did .
We fought only for India ' s independence .
I do not deny having taken part in the fight but I did so as a member of the regular fighting forces of the Provisional Government of Free India who waged war for the liberation of their motherland according to the rules of civilised warfare .
I also maintain that my trial by court martial is illegal .
The defence also established that the acts , which were the subject matter of the charges , were acts done in the course of operations of the organised army of a government which could claim the status of statehood , which possessed territories ceded to it by the Japanese , and which had been accorded recognition as a government by other States , and had received the plenipotentiary of another State , and had formally declared war against the British and America .
Interesting questions regarding the law of belligerency were discussed .
The existence of war was purely a question of fact .
Whether a struggle amounted to a war or not was to be determined not from the relation of the combatants to each other , but from the mode in which the struggle was carried on .
If in exercise of what has been called the sacred right of rebellion , a considerable body of subjects of a State rose in revolt and the struggle became a popular uprising , then that population was entitled to be treated as belligerents .
In other words , if in making its struggle for freedom , a subject people reached a stage at which it could be said to be a struggle waged by an organised army according to the accepted rules of war , then that army must be accorded all the rights , privileges and immunities of the army of a belligerent State in war .
That status of belligerency will involve immunity in respect of all acts done in the prosecution of that war . Insurgents fighting against their parent State for liberation may fail or succeed .
According to the maxim of International Law , the successful revolution would be the government established by law .
But even if the revolution fails , if the fight they carried on was a fight by an organised army in the manner of war , they would still be entitled to recognition as belligerents .
So far as argument of allegiance owed by officers of the Indian Army who had joined the I . N . A . was concerned , it may be said that allegiance was owed to the King and the country .
Before Sheikh Abdullah is convicted , these questions must be considered very carefully and weighed in the spirit of the grave responsibility because of the repercussions which are inevitable .
The mischief of conviction is greater than even the mischief caused by the alleged speeches or rather by the arrest of the accused .
The remedy sought is worse than the disease .
You convict and incarcerate a person and all possibility of reconciliation between the ruler and the ruled is washed out .
Do not let the people think that the raising of their voices by their leaders means only convictions , sentences , misery and wretchedness .
Let them feel that the ruler is there for his people and that he is fully conscious of the feelings and sentiments of his people and who can say , ' I am high enough to be able to overlook even a wrong committed by my people ' .
" This is the only way of dealing with this trouble . One conviction will not solve the problem ; it will only make remedy worse than the disease ; it will drive hundreds of thousands into the wilderness of resentment , sullenness and non - co - operation .
The court passed the following order : " Offences under Section 124 - A R . P . C . for all the three speeches are proved against him .
He is convicted under the above Section on all the three counts and sentenced to three years ' simple imprisonment with a fine of rupees five hundred on each score .
In default of payment of . fine , he shall further undergo simple imprisonment for three months on each count .
The sentences of imprisonment shall run concurrently . "
Sheikh Abdullah was convicted on 10th September , 1946 .
India achieved independence on 15th August , 1947 .
There was no way left for the Maharaja of the princely State of Kashmir but to release Sheikh Abdullah who was set free on 29th September , 1947 .
The ' Lion of Kashmir ' was soon made the first Chief Minister of Kashmir .
The trial of Sheikh Abdullah imparted futher impetus to the ' Quit Kashmir ' movement which now spread to other parts of the country .
Sheikh Abdullah ' s speeches made on 10th , 12th , 14th and 16th of May , 1946 followed by Asaf All ' s spirited defence of the ' Lion of Kashmir ' paved the way for surrender by rulers of various princely States in India .
What is Unicode ?
Unicode provides a unique number for every character ,
no matter what the platform ,
no matter what the program ,
no matter what the language .
Fundamentally , computers just deal with numbers .
They store letters and other characters by assigning a number for each one .
Before Unicode was invented , there were hundreds of different encoding systems for assigning these numbers .
No single encoding could contain enough characters : for example , the European Union alone requires several different encodings to cover all its languages .
Even for a single language like English no single encoding was adequate for all the letters , punctuation , and technical symbols in common use .
These encoding systems also conflict with one another .
That is , two encodings can use the same number for two different characters , or use different numbers for the same character .
Any given computer ( especially servers ) needs to support many different encodings ; yet whenever data is passed between different encodings or platforms , that data always runs the risk of corruption .
Unicode is changing all that !
Unicode provides a unique number for every character , no matter what the platform , no matter what the program , no matter what the language .
The Unicode Standard has been adopted by such industry leaders as Apple , HP , IBM , JustSystem , Microsoft , Oracle , SAP , Sun , Sybase , Unisys and many others .
Unicode is required by modern standards such as XML , Java , ECMAScript ( JavaScript ) , LDAP , CORBA 3.0 , WML , etc . , and is the official way to implement ISO / IEC 10646 .
It is supported in many operating systems , all modern browsers , and many other products .
The emergence of the Unicode Standard , and the availability of tools supporting it , are among the most significant recent global software technology trends .
Incorporating Unicode into client - server or multi - tiered applications and websites offers significant cost savings over the use of legacy character sets .
Unicode enables a single software product or a single website to be targeted across multiple platforms , languages and countries without re - engineering .
It allows data to be transported through many different systems without corruption .
The Unicode Consortium is a non - profit organization founded to develop , extend and promote use of the Unicode Standard , which specifies the representation of text in modern software products and standards .
The membership of the consortium represents a broad spectrum of corporations and organizations in the computer and information processing industry .
Membership in the Unicode Consortium is open to organizations and individuals anywhere in the world who support the Unicode Standard and wish to assist in its extension and implementation .

- K . V . Narain Our environment comprises air , water and land and these are technically known as atmosphere , hydrosphere and lithosphere respectively .
Not only are the precious non - renewable resources carelessly squandered , but in the process man has exposed the future generations to various hazards through application of pesticides and release of radioactive wastes .
Irrespective of the country and place , a hue and cry about pollution is being raised now .
Pollution befouls the air and poisons water .
To meet the growing needs for power , hydro - electric , thermal , and nuclear power plants are being increasingly set up .
The net result is pollution of air and water everywhere .
Air pollution in cities has mounted with more and more people getting drawn to the urban centres .
According to the 1951 Census , the urban population was around 62 million ; the 1981 Census figures put it at 158 milliona 150 per cent increase in just three decades .
Some of them are also carried to distant places by wind , rain and rivers .
These are also present in the high mountains and in seaside swamps , and are hazardous for human beings , animals , birds and fish .
It is reported that in a particular part of Russia , lung cancer has increased by 50 per cent in the last five years , stomach cancer rates by 30 per cent , and birth defects by about 55 per cent all caused apparently due to excessive use of pesticides .
Another kind of pollution that has come into prominence more recently is radiation which is a result of the growth of nuclear power and nuclear weapons .
Radioactive materials find their way into the atmosphere and water courses causing mutagenetic effects .
The number of nuclear plants in operation , though small at present and considered relatively safe , may cause environmental and health problems of immense magnitude .
Mining operations , especially in reserve forests and sanctuaries , are posing a serious threat to the environment .
To cite an example , Sariska , the game sanctuary nestling in the Aravalli Hills ( Rajasthan ) and known the world over for its tigers , has now become a dumping ground for mining wastes .
All kinds of animals , including the tiger , are virtually fighting for survival .
Lastly , mention has to be made about pollution caused by noise .
Pollution is like a tiger lurking in the bush , ready to pounce upon us at any time , leading to total destruction .
It is like the Damocle ' s sword hanging over our head .
The human race is trying to commit suicide the pistol being pollution .
We have poisoned the air , water , and soil with pollutants .
We have upset natural communities in ways that are affecting our place in the complex system that has been called ' the great chain of life ' .
And we may soon be tipping the balance of the natural forces in the earth , atmosphere and oceans in ways that could be disastrous for mankind .
We have reached a point where we must protect the environment in order to protect ourselves .
Air pollution has never been as bad as it is now .
Even as we benefit from industrial progress , we must ensure that the very air we breathe remains unpoisoned . "
For instance , a 500 - MW thermal power plant produces 2,000 tonnes of ash every day , in addition to smoke .
Other significant industries contributing to air pollution are cement , steel and ore processing industries .
The automobile exhausts are in no way less dangerous than the industrial smoke .
It is reported that automobiles at Greater Calcutta alone spew about 1,500 tonnes of pollutants into the atmosphere every day .
To meet the demands of an exploding population , the number of buses plying on the roads are being increased .
Delhi ' s vehicular strength in 1992 was estimated to be about 19 lakhs . The number of motor vehicles plying in Madras city is nearing 5 lakhs .
At Hyderabad the number of motor vehicles is estimated to be 4.7 lakhs which emit 450 . tonnes of smoke and fumes a day .
Air Pollution in Cities One may be astonished to note the stupendous amounts of air pollutants ( as per 1980 estimates ) released in the atmosphere per annum in India alone .
The pollutants comprise 10 lakh tonnes of carbon monoxide , 30 lakh tonnes of sulphur dioxide , 10 lakh tonnes of carbon monoxide , 2 lakh tonnes of hydrogen sulphide , and 50 lakh tonnes of particulate matter .
Special mention may be made here about the thermal power stations in India which number about 66 at present and discharge 30 to 40 million tonnes of fly ash per annum , i . e . 1 lakh tonnes per day .
The total air pollution load in Bombay is estimated to be about 2,971 tonnes per day , with 1,357 tonnes per day coming from industries , 1,538 tonnes from vehicle exhaust and 62 tonnes from domestic smoke .
The average level of the sulphur present in the atmosphere over Bombay is reported to be twice that of the safety limit ; certain pockets in Bombay have already crossed the danger mark .
The pollution in Delhi can best be described in N . K . Doval ' s words , " The ambient air quality in Delhi gives it the dubious distinction of being the fourth most polluted city in the world .
Persons already suffering from diseases like anaemia are more prone to get affected because carbon monoxide may lead to serious injuries to vital organs .
It has been reported that lower levels of concentration of sulphur dioxide cause temporary spasm of the smooth muscles of the bronchia .
The cilia which protect the respiratory system get affected by sulphur dioxide causing cough , shortness of breath and spasm of the larynx .
It may also cause acute irritation of the eye membranes resulting in tears and redness .
Hydrogen sulphide is well known for its characteristic rotten - egg odour .
Lead , which is discharged into the air via the automobile exhaust , is a cumulative poison that may cause brain damage in children .
A report on the Donora ( USA ) industrial accident showed that about 20 per cent of the canary population and 15 per cent dogs were affected .
Plumbism or lead poisoning among cattle , sheep and horses is a common phenomenon .
Pastures along busy roads contain substantial amounts of lead and , animals grazing on them become susceptible to lead poisoning as it accumulates in their tissues .
Air contaminated with ozone acts as an irritant and can be responsible for pulmonary changes , oedema and haemorrhage in dogs , cats and rabbits .
Though airborne fluorides do not attack animals directly , but when they eat fluoride containing crops continuously , symptoms of fluorosis appear . Animal fluorosis manifests itself by mottling , staining and pitting . of incisor teeth . Cattle and sheep are most frequently affected , though horses and poultry seem to have a high resistance to fluorides .
Bone lesions in animals due to excessive fluorides have also been reported .
Diarrhoea , weight loss , lowered fertility and reduced milk production are some of the other effects of fluoride pollution .
A Liberian oil - tanker ran aground on the south - east coast of Great Britain , spilling about 60,000 gallons of crude oil into the sea .
The resultant oil slick led to the death of a large number of fish and sea - birds .
This accident made the world sit up to the dangers of oil spills .
In 1969 , the Santa Barbara , California became the focal point due to the damage caused by the blow out of a well in the channel .
Not only was the beach affected but even some birds and other creatures faced death due to the spread of oil .
Just after the spill it was claimed that the channel had become an ' ecological desert ' , though recent investigations reveal that the damage was not so serious .
In 1978 , a supertanker hit a reef , off the coast of Alaska releasing 11 million gallons of oil over the sea .
When the oil hit the shore , about 1,00,000 birds died .
Seals and porpoises ( a sea mammal resembling dolphin in appearance ) were also poisoned and they sank to the bottom of the ocean .
During 1974 an American tanker Transhuron ran aground on an atoll of the Kiltan Island ( Lakshadweep ) and spilled over 5,000 tonnes of special navy fuel oil .
In 1976 , a Greek tanker disappeared off Veraval without any wreckage , but large oil slicks were observed floating on the surface , close to the west coast of India .
At times oil gets spread on the sea by the intentional discharge of oil ( as during the Gulf War of 1991 ) .
The slicks stretched over an area of 100 km by 15 km and were half a metre thick at certain places .
Such ' environmental terrorism ' can alter the ecology of the region in the future .
It was practised even in the ancient days .
The same strategy was adopted during the Gulf War by releasirg oil into the sea unmindful of the damage done to the entire planet .
Millions of sea birds were threatened by this oil slick .
The deadly oil coating on their body prevented them from diving for fish and they were starved to death .
It is estimated that the amount of floating tar at any time on the surface of the Arabian Sea can be around 3,700 tonnes and on the route across the southern Bay of Bengal could amount to 1,100 tonnes .
Due to constant exposure to oil films in the sea , most coral reefs in the Indian Ocean regionin the Kawaratti reef in Lakshadweep , in the Nicobar Island , and in the south - west part of Malagasy have more or less disappeared .
To avoid harm caused by oil slicks , some of the following practices are adopted :
The oil slick is set on fire .
The oil is skimmed off from the surface with a suction 68 WE BREATHE AND DRINK POISON device .
" The vessels engaged for this operation are termed as ' skimmers ' . Absorbents like sawdust are spread over the oil slicks , and after a certain time the absorbents along with the oil are removed . Sometimes oil - eating microbes are sprayed over the area which in due course degrade the oil . Sinking is another fruitful measure , in which powdered or fine granular solids of high density are sprayed over the oil patch so as to mix with the oil , adhere to it and sink it . The most satisfactory method at present available is to disperse or emulsify the oil with suitable dispersing or emulsifying agents .
Have you heard of mountains that are man - made ?
Is it possible to produce such mountains ?
It is no wonder that every urban area has hillocks in each street .
A table indicating the tonnage of solid wastes produced in major cities of India is given as follows : Industrial solid wastes also add to the problem .
These wastes are disposed from coal and mineral industries , mining industries , metal industries , engineering industries and thermal power stations .
It has been reported that about 50 per cent of the raw material ultimately becomes waste product in industry , and about 15 per cent of it are toxic or deleterious .
Millions of tonnes of slag have been disposed by metal extraction industries , especially iron and steel plants . A larger quantity of the solid waste is attributed to the sludge from wet processing industries from where it is produced during industrial effluent treatment .
Another important solid waste which is noteworthy is biomedical waste .
This waste includes anatomical waste , syringes , gauze , absorbents , glass , etc .
The huge dumps of biomedical wastes disposed of by hospitals and clinics cause serious health problems .
Ordinances have been promulgated not to dump the waste and for safe transportation in special containers , and subsequent incineration in Australia and other countries .
Why are solid wastes cause for such serious concern ?
This is a valuable manure of exceptional use in drylands as it conserves the moisture and releases plant nutrients gradually .
Experiments are being conducted to obtain glucose and subsequently alcohol from the cellulose in the garbage .
The quantity of fly ash produced in thermal power stations is high and its disposal is a serious problem all over the world .
Fly ash is the finer ash obtained during burning of coal in thermal power stations and constitutes about 80 - 85 per cent of the total ash produced .
In India there are 66 thermal power stations and they produce about 30 - 40 million tonnes of fly ash per annum ( about 1 lakh tonnes per day ) .
It is either dumped in dry form in bags or made into slurry ( to avert air pollution ) to pass on to ash ponds from where it is discharged into the nearby water course .
Latest estimates indicate that if the fly ash is simply dumped over the years , about 283 sq km of land would be required by the end of this century , which may lead to serious ecological problems .
Research is being conducted throughout the world for the utilisation of fly ash for useful purposes so as to overcome the need for enormous amounts of water and land for disposal .
In toto , there are 434 units in operation in 26 countries with a capacity of 316,000 MWe and 100 units are under construction with a capacity of 80,000 MWe .
In India too , we have nuclear power plants though not on so large a scale as in the western nations .
A fire in the plant allowed massive amounts of radiation to be released into the atmosphere .
This fallout drifted into Scandinavia and eastern Europe , causing enormous damage to crops and livestock .
This however does not demean the advantages of nuclear power stations over others utilising conventional fuels such as coal and oil .
When compared to other sources of energy , the nuclear source is clean , compact and concentrated .
Nuclear power stations do not emit sulphur dioxide ( causative agent of acid rain ) , carbon dioxide ( major contributor to greenhouse effect ) , oxides of nitrogen or heavy metal pollutants .
They are economical as they require only a minimum area of land and the quantum . of energy generated is greater ( 1 kg of uranium gives out energy equivalent to 25,000 kg of coal ) .
In addition to the specified number of trees , as declared by the forest officials , greedy contractors axe many more trees ( both young and old ) for commercial purposes .
Illegal felling of trees so as to mint money within a short span of time is leading to denudation of vast stretches of forests .
Mining is also a major cause for such denudation of forests .
While we need ' mineral wealth , we have also to protect our rich forests .
Unfortunately it took very long for the government to realise that clearing of forests for mining was putting the future generation under peril .
To cite an example , the Maikal ranges in Madhya Pradesh have been mined for bauxite , leading to rapid denudation .
The fourth reason is conversion of forest areas into cultivable land .
Apple and tea cultivation are prominent agricultural practices in the converted forest areas .
Large tracts of the Himalayan forests have been destroyed for the cultivation of apple .
To maintain a sound ecological balance one - third of our country ' s total land area should be under forest cover , whereas in reality only about 10 per cent of the land has good forest cover ( National Remote Sensing Agency , 1982 ) .
If our country ' s forest cover has to increase , along with afforestation schemes , non - agriculturable lands and other wastelands have to be brought under forest cover .
The afforestation scheme will meet the increasing demand for fuel , fodder , etc . and simultaneously protect our environment .
Further , people must plant more trees and save the existing ones .
We have to think of ourselves not only as beneficiaries but also as trustees of the wealth which comes to us through our forests .
Our slogan hereafter should be ' Plant a tree today and nurture it every day . '
From the preceding chapters , it becomes clear that the earth which feeds us and provides us home , is under peril .
Man ' s greed has led to depletion of natural reserves and resources .
Unless steps are taken on a war footing , the earth will lose its capacity to hold us and deprive us as also other living beings of the livelihood .
Above all , human attitude towards environmental conservation is more important .
Many of the hygienic problems arising in most urban and rural areas can be solved if each citizen decides not to throw garbage on the streets and not to use streets as dustbins .
It is ironical that in the name of progress we are depleting our forests and disturbing our ecological balance .
Urbanisation , rarely accompanied by large - scale , long - range planning , has turned many urban and suburban areas into commercial jungles .
Urban growth , spread of agriculture , building of dams and loss of forests have destroyed wildlife habitats .
A large number of species or sub - species of animals are under threat of extinction .
Besides destroying wildlife habitats , we are poisoning animals and their food with pesticides , herbicides and other chemicals .
These chemicals are killing fish , birds and beneficial insects .
But the first impressions are always more vivid and lasting and Tagore would henceforth be regarded in the West as primarily a religious and philosophic poet .
His own biblical personality and august mien and his insistent harping on the ideals of ancient forest sages helped to confirm the one - sided impression .
Ezra Pound who saw him as one poet sees another tried to correct the distorted image but his was a lone voice .
Reviewing The Gardener in the Freewoman he said : " Why the good people of this island are unable to honour a fine artist as such ; why they are incapable , or apparently incapable , of devising for his honour any better device than that of wrapping his life in cotton wool and parading about with the effigy of a sanctimonious moralist , remains and will remain for me an unsolvable mystery . "
In September Tagore sailed for India , having achieved both fame and health .
It was while he was in Santiniketan that the news came on 13 November of the award of the Nobel Prize for his Gitanjali The news was received with no small surprise and much rejoicing all over the country .
What did the poet himself feel ?
He would not be human if he felt otherwise .
The , patriot in him felt happy , too , that his country ' s name had been put on the world ' s literary map and felt proud that he was the reason of it .
But the poet in him was too sensitive not to feel a misgiving that his days of peace , of a quiet and uninterrupted pursuit of his vocation as a poet and as a teacher of little children , of intimate whisperings with his God , were over .
Five days later he wrote to Rothenstein : " The perfect whirlwind of public excitement it has given rise to is frightful .
It is almost as bad as trying a tin can . at a dog ' s tail making it impossible for him to move without creating noise and collecting crowds all along .
I am being smothered with telegrams and letters for the last few days and the people who never had any friendly feelings towards me nor ever read a line of my works are loudest in their protestations of joy .
This sad and bitter thought found public expression on 23 November when a large deputation of 500 distinguished citizens of Calcutta representing divers professions and interests came by a special train to Santiniketan to offer him the nation ' s felicitations .
In blunt but poetic words the poet told them that he could not accept a homage that was so unreal .
Those among his audience who had always been his warm admirers understood for whom the snub was meant ; the rest , thus deflated , never forgave him for what they considered his " inhospitable reply " .
Though the Prize was awarded on the merit of an individual work whose poetic excellence and high idealism were almost universally acknowledged , the fact that it was given to an Asian invested the award with a significance which such awards do not normally have and made it look almost like a unique phenomenon .
It was received everywhere with a shock of surprise and turned Rabindranath from an individual into a symbola symbol of the West ' s grudging recognition of Asia ' s submerged potential and its imminent resurgence .
The records of the Selection Committee show that this proposal came as a surprise to the Swedish Academy .
The two members whose eloquent and powerful support swayed the decision of the Nobel Committee were Vernervon Heidenstam , who was himself awarded the Nobel Prize three years later , and Per Hallstrom , member - Secretary of the Nobel Cbmmittee .
In a way it goes against the grain to associate a monetary prize with this purely religious poetry .
It is like paying for the Psalms ( of David ) or the songs of St . Francis . "
" To make such comparisons would be ridiculous if it was a question of modern European poetry , however great its merits might be ; it is not at all absurd when referring to Gitanjali . . .
The mode of expression is of classical simplicity , the image is only the spontaneous language of thought , and it does not need to be moulded into shape , it is even complete through the mere mention of the word .
One thinks of the Brahmin lady in Goethe ' s poem , who scooped up water from a flowing stream with her hands , and the water became solid and malleable in her hands . . .
All the English reviewers express the opinion that they are the witnesses of a truly epoch - making phenomenon , not only as regards the understanding of Oriental life , but also as far as its possible influence on European art is concerned . . .
We are told that Tagore ' s compatriots consider that a new literary period , and the greatest in the history of their language , begins with his appearance .
From now on he belonged to the world as much as he belonged to India .
Or so he believednot because he became world - famous but because he felt with the world .
There have been many men world - famous who were world - scourges , and many who have failed to see beyond their noses .
This world - consciousness which was very real in him exposed him to not a little misunderstanding in his own country .
Being more Christian than missionary both of them broke away from their organisations in order to be free to serve the people in the spiritof Christ as they understood it , and became Tagore ' s associates and lifelong friends .
Tagore who had anticipated , with the true insight of a poet - seer , the advent of the Mahatma in his dramas and verse , was already with him in spit it , so that when Andrews and Pearson left him in November 1913 , for South Africa to study the Passive Resistance movement bn the spot , they carried with them his goodwill and best wishes for the success of Gandhi ' s mission .
It was the first full flush of our common enthusiasm and love for him and it coloured all our existence with its own bright hues .
The very sky itself seemed more glorious as we spoke about him and shared our thoughts together .
This was also for us both the happy moment of discovery of a new friendship with Mahatma Gandhi .
These two affections were blended into one in a very intimate manner .
Often under the stars at night we would sit in the silence and then speak to one another in quiet accents of the wonderful evenings we had spent with our Gurudev on the terrace outside his little room at Santiniketan .
Those were golden moments and Mahatma realised with deep sympathy our own hearts ' devotion to the poet .
He often spoke to us of his own great longing to meet him .
Thus we were all drawn together into a single circle of affection . "
The end of the year 1913 was marked by Calcutta University conferring a doctorate on Tagore at a special convocation held on 26 December .
The three books published in London , The Gardener , The Crescent Moon and Chitra , were all translations .
Several songs were , however , written by him during this year , some during his sojourn abroad and some in India .
The only one written in the United States in the beginning of the year is significant for its employment of the metaphor of buying and selling .
The poet imagines himself carrying his burden of wares and hawking them from place to place , The King threatens to take his wares by force , the aged millionaire offers to buy them with gold , a lovely maiden tempts him with a smile , but the burden remainsuntil a child playing with a sea - shell pulls him by the sleeve and says , all this is mine .
He is relieved of his burden These songs which he continued to write , both words and . music , and which were published in 1914 in two volumes , Gitimalya and Gitali , are some of the finest he ever wrote and continued the religious strain of Gitanjali , though the mood was changing .
His faith had gained firmness , his confidence in man ' s destiny was now more robust and his acceptance of life and its responsibilities more gladsome .
Their joy is equally shared by the literate and the illiterate , by the young and the old , and through them is expressed an endless variety of moods and feelings in all their modulations and nuances .
The words , rhythms and symbols used are so simple as to them spontaneous , as if they could not but be what they are .
He must calmly face the struggle and not be scared of suffering .
" How will you conquer sorrow if you flee from it ?
The poison must burn itself out in its own fire .
I think it has been the good fortune of the west to have the opportunity of absorbing the spirit of the east through the medium of Bible .
It has added to the richness of your life because it is alien to your temperament .
In course of time you may discard some of its doctrines and teachings but it has done its work it has created a bifurcation in your mental system which is so needful for all life growth .
The western literature is doing the same with us , bringing into our life elements some of which supplement and some contradict our tendencies .
These later stories dealt with middle - class life and its problems , in particular the tragedy of woman in a Hindu household , and if they lack the sweet aroma of fresh fruit , they have the appetising smell of well - processed cheese .
The author ' s irony in exposing the cowardice and selfishness of the smug Hindu husband is as subtle and sharp as his courage is admirable in denouncing injustice perpetrated in the name of holy scriptures and tradition .
Haimanti , the brave daughter of a helpless father in the story of that name , finds deliverance in death ; the clever , beautiful and strong - willed Mrinal who had a mind of her own redeems her futile existence by her courage in renouncing her husband and home .
She is Tagore ' s Nora flinging her manifesto of independence in her husband ' s face .
Needless to say , the author was reviled in the Bengali press for his indictment of social injusticeabused by the very leaders who were clamouring against political injustice .
In a third story , " Aparichita " ( The Unknown Girl ) he shows how an educated and spirited Bengali girl is more than a match for the namby - pamby youth who imagined he was doing her favour by condescending to marry her .
All these stories are in the first person singular and the central character in each is made to reveal his or her own inmost feelings .
Another very beautiful story is " Boshtami " , the story of a woman who had renounced her home to become a devotee of God .
Tagore had actually known such a woman in a Bengali village and he later described her , with much respect and feeling , in his Creative Unity .
Nor did he take sides .
To him the war was as a wound in the breast of humanity , its pain and horror to be shared by all its limbs , however seemingly far removed .
In an address to his students at Santiniketan he emphasised that as the sins of fathers are visited on children , so all humanity must share the guilt and its punishment for whatever crimes are committed by man anywhere .
In , a moving poem he said : " All the sorrows of the earth , its sins and crimes , its heart - breaks and its lust for violence , have swelled like a tidal wave overleaping the banks , blaspheming the skies .
This and many other poems ( including a sonnet on Shakespeare ) he wrote during these uneasy months when he moved restlessly from place to place , alternating between anguish and elation , nostalgia and expectation , vaguely apprehensive that he stood on the brink of a new phase of himself .
What in him will recede or die and what will emerge , he did not know .
All he knew was that he must move on , renew and , if need be , outgrow himself .
They were all published in 1916 in a slender volume called Balaka ( A Flight of Geese ) .
This volume , dedicated to his young English friend Pearson , marks one of the great peaks which Tagore periodically scaled in his Himalayan pilgrimage .
The book takes its name from the poem written in Kashmir where the author , watching in the evening " the curving stream of Jhelum glimmering in the dusk like a scimitar , " is suddenly roused from his reverie by " the lightning streak of a sound hurtling across the void " and looks up to see a flock of geese winging their way to somewhere far away .
This migratory flight of birds symbolises for him the perennial motion in all things , moving or seemingly motionless , the passage of the time spirit , the unending quest of life and of the soul , the eternal cry in the heart of the universe : " Not here , not here , but somewhere else ! "
He must have chanced upon an old photograph of hers , for the poem is addressed to it .
The same idea , of life perpetually renewing itself , of Winter throwing off its mask to reveal itself as Spring , is embodied in a delightful phantasy which he wrote for his boys at Santiniketan - Phalgni ( The cycle of Spring ) .
The play was staged both at Santiniketan and in Calcutta , Tagore playing the double role of the Poet and the blind Baul or wandering minstrel .
A group of young urchins pursue the old man Winter and disrobe him , only to discover that he is none other than Spring .
Edward Thompson who was present at the first performance felt that " it was wild - wood music , such as the spirit of the bamboo , the spirit of the south wind , the spirit of the flowers might sing , if they took human voice . "
For his character , in his own way , is as great and as creative as that of Tagore himself .
It is , however , of more ascetic order .
It has about it rather an air of religious faith of the Middle Ages than that of modern times .
Tagore is essentially a modern ; Mahatma Gandhi is the St . Francis of Assissi of our own days . "
Having won recognition abroad , Tagore had become respectable in the eyes of die British Government of India .
Gone were the days when the Government servants were warned not to send their children to his school .
Now the highest British dignitary in Bengal came to pay his respects .
Tagore gave the honoured guest a cordial reception and elaborate arrangements were made in the asrama to welcome him .
" Patriots " were not wanting who criticised Tagore for honouring the representative of foreign rulers .
